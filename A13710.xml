         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Luke. 19. 41. &amp;c.</bibl>
               <q>And when he was come neere the Cittie, hee beheld it, and wept for it, ſaying: oh, if thou hadst knowne euen at the least, in this thy day, thoſe things that belong vnto thy peace: but now are they hid from thine eyes. &amp;c.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the ſeauenth of Eccles: and 4. verſe, it is written, That it is better to goe into the houſe of mourning, than into the houſe of feaſting; and therefore I haue choſen a tragicall Text, ſounding foorth nothing but paſſions and mournful notes: like the tunes of thoſe baniſhed Iſraelites <note place="margin">Pſal. 137.</note> vpon Babilons banks.</p>
            <p>The firſt voice that euer proceeded from Adam our progenitor after his fall, was a voyce compounded of ſorrow and feare, <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 10.</note> when God called vpon him, while hee hid himſelfe among the trees of the garden: &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:3643:5"/> all Adams children ought to bee like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, paſſionate and ſorrowfull, making theyr whole life ſutable to theyr infancie, as wee all come to the worlde by a ſorrowfull conception.</p>
            <p>In the 33. of Geneſis, Iacob coulde not meete his brother, but their eyes muſt ſtreame forth teares.</p>
            <p>And in the 23. chap. we finde Abraham the Patriarch an old man in yeeres, a verie childe in teares, mourning &amp; weeping.</p>
            <p>In Ioſiah his time, whole multitudes are recorded to goe out, and weepe before the Lord.</p>
            <p>Not to ſtand vpon particulers, which are not neceſſary in ſo cleere a truth, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the very mirror of ſorow, is in this place preſented vnto vs weeping pittifully vpon Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>Wherein wee are by the way to note the differences betweene the godly &amp; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, betweene the children of God, &amp; the children of this world.</p>
            <p>The godlie are euer noted rather ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then reioycing, rather bewailing &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting theyr ſinfull condition, than ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themſelues with the vaine pleaſures of
<pb facs="tcp:3643:5"/> this tranſitory life.</p>
            <p>VVee finde not them at any time either <note place="margin">Gen, 9, 22. Mar, 6, 22. Dan, 5. 2.</note> ſporting it like Cham, or dauncing like Herodias, or carowſing like Belſhazar.</p>
            <p>Search the volume of holy Writ, from Moſes, vnto Iohn that ſaw ſo many miſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Pathmos, and wee ſhall finde a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary humour, and another kinde of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raigning in the righteous.</p>
            <p>Moſes, as hee was drawne vp from the waters, ſo hee ſhewed himſelfe in the courſe of his life, to be (as it were) quite ſwallowed vp with the ouerflowing waters of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and he prayed God to race him out of his booke that he had written, in the 32. of <note place="margin">Exod, 32.</note> Exodus.</p>
            <p>Dauid watered his couch with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all teares.</p>
            <p>Paule wept for the Corinthians. <note place="margin">2, Cor, 2. Luke. 22. 62</note>
            </p>
            <p>Peter went out to weepe bitterly for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his Lord.</p>
            <p>And to come to our example in thys place, Chriſt Ieſus, though hee were the Sonne of GOD, ſhewes himſelfe in thys to be alſo the ſonne of man, he ſhed many a ſalt teare ouer Ieruſalem.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:6"/>
            <p>VVho among vs can be ſo deuoted, and ſo ſolde ouer (as it were) to ſinfull vanitie, now to be ſporting, ſeeing Chriſt our Lord ſo heauy and paſſionate?</p>
            <p>The generall propoſition vvhich Saint Luke vrgeth in this hiſtoricall diſcourſe of Chriſt his trauailing to Ieruſalem, is thys: Hee prooueth that in this place, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is the ſcope and drift of the vvhole Booke: viz. to cleere to the world, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the vnbeleeuing Iewes, that Chriſt is the only Meſſias or Sauiour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo by his birth, his life &amp; death, liuing, dying, riſing, and aſcending.</p>
            <p>As Iohn the Baptiſt poynted at Chriſt the Lambe of GOD, purging the ſinnes of the world; ſo heere Saint Luke poynts at Chriſt, vveeping for the ſinnes of the world.</p>
            <p>When the people of Ieruſalem laughed, Chriſt wept, as when the Miniſtrell played, Eliſha prophecied: and therefore this Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, otherwiſe famous, but in this infamous,
<note place="margin">2. Reg 3. 15</note> worthily ranne to ruine, and ſo receiued a true and due recompence for her ſecuritie. </p>
            <q>And when he drew neere the Cutie, hee beheld it, and wept for it.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>The perſon,]</hi> who came to Ieruſalem, was Chriſt. And the Scripture doth manifeſtlie declare how great he was: for he was God. <hi>The Father and I are one.</hi> Ioh. 10.</p>
            <p>How humble he was: for he was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the worlde. His humilitie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in taking our nature vpon him. Being God, it pleaſed him to become man, and to dwell with men: hee withdrew himſelfe from none, no not from the Publicans and ſinners.</p>
            <p>That Ieſus, who was <hi>Contempte Mundi,</hi> a hater of this worlde, one that nothing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the pompe and glory thereof: for when the Tempter preſented before him at one viewe all the kingdoms of the earth, <note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> Tempter and temptation were both driuen to retire. One powerfull worde of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:3643:7"/> quite vanquiſht him, as Dauid ouercame Golias with one ſtone, when it perced into his temples.</p>
            <p>That Ieſus who refuſed all worldly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie and power: for when in the ſixt of Iohn they woulde haue made him theyr King, he conueyed himſelfe out of the way. Who was mercifull, for he forgaue the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in adultery.</p>
            <p>Who was powerful: for his words made the ſouldiours giue backe when they came to take him. As in the 4. of Mathewe, his worde made the prince of darkneſſe giue backe when he came to tempt him.</p>
            <p>Who was pittifull, this place proueth it. <hi>He wept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Chriſt who is called <hi>Vera lux,</hi> the true light for the ſaued to walke in. The
<note place="margin">Iohn, 1, 5, Reu, 22, 16,</note> bright Morning ſtar. The flower of leſſe. The mighty Lyon of the trybe of Iudah. The Author, and finiſher of our fayth.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that excellent voyce of glory once ſounded from the heauens: <hi>This is my well beloued ſonne in whom I am</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke, 3, 22,</note> 
               <hi>well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee who was promiſed by the Father, figured in the Lawe, ſpoken of by the
<pb facs="tcp:3643:8"/> Prophets, poynted at by Iohn Baptiſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh, iuſtified in the Spirit, ſeene of Angels, preached to the Gentiles, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16.</note> beleeued on in the world, and receiued vp in glory. This Chriſt came to Ieruſalem. So much briefely is ſpoken for the perſon, now for the place.</p>
            <p>The place whether Chriſt came, was <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> the Metropolis or chiefe Citty in all Aſia, by interpretation, <hi>A viſion of peace.</hi> Yet this people knevve not their peace.</p>
            <p>God had ſtampt a remembrance of his bleſſings in the very name of Ieruſalem, yet could not this people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of it, they made no vſe of this peace which God had giuen them.</p>
            <p>This Citty had in it many faults in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes time. For firſt they knewe not theyr peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they prophaned the Temple of God, making it a denne of theeues, and a ſhop of Merchants, where it ſhould haue beene the houſe of prayer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in it were the Prophets ſlaine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it foſtered within it the greateſt enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:8"/>
            <p>Fiftly, beeing the Citty of the great King, it was allotted to deſtroy the great King Chriſt Ieſus, the King of glory.</p>
            <p>This Citty ſo polluted Chriſt comes to viſite.</p>
            <p>As once God the Father ſaid, <hi>Come let vs goe downe and viſit Babel:</hi> ſo heere Chriſt <note place="margin">Gene, 11, 7,</note> the Sonne ſayth to his Apoſtles, <hi>Come let vs goe viſite Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which his comming to Ieruſalem, we ſee it firſt noted by the Euangeliſt he drew neere the Citty: for beeing a Prophet, hee would doe as did the Prophets. Samuell came neere to Iſraell, Ionas came to viſite Niniuie, and Chriſt came heere to viſit Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. </p>
            <q>Hee drew neere to it.</q>
            <p>Hauing firſt trauailed to Iericho, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Beth-phage, and then to Bethany, at laſt he comes to Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>Wherein wee are to note the great dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Chriſt, to verifie his former words, <hi>I came to ſeeke and to ſaue that which was lost.</hi> He neuer ceaſed to doe the will of his Father.</p>
            <p>Beeing but twelue yeeres old, he taught in the Temple, and diſputed vvith the
<pb facs="tcp:3643:9"/> Doctors, hearing them, &amp; appoſing them. <note place="margin">Luke, 2, 46,</note> We ſhould be armed with like induſtrious diligence.</p>
            <p>The chyldren of God are euer noted to be eyther going, or walking, or running.</p>
            <p>Peter, during the time of his fall, is noted ſitting, to ſhew his carefulnes: but ſo ſoone as hee felt the ſoule-ſtirring motions of Gods Spirit calling him to repentance, hee
<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 62.</note> ſits no longer, but goeth out.</p>
            <p>The Iſraelites are recorded to be alwaies <note place="margin">Num. 33.</note> trauailing, and remouing, till they came to Canaan.</p>
            <p>Moſes, ſo ſoone as hee was borne, was <note place="margin">Exod. 2. 3.</note> caſt out among the flagges, from thence he was brought to the Kings Court in Egypt. After that, he was driuen to ſhe to Midian, and from Mydian backe againe to Egypt. And after all this, what long and tedious trauels did hee vndergoe in that long iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Canaan.</p>
            <p>Wherein is rightly typed the ſtate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery religious Chriſtian mans life.</p>
            <p>Our life heere is but a pilgrimage, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing vapour that ſuddainly is loſt, while a man lookes vpon it: and therefore holie men muſt learne of Moſes, and of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:9"/> to redeeme the time, by walking towardes God, and by trauailing about our Fathers buſines, as Chriſt trauailed about his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers buſines, when hee went to Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>This is the pilgrimage that beſt pleaſeth God, and not that of the Idolatrous Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians of this age, the Ieſuites I meane, and Seminaries, which take great paines to compaſſe ſea and land, to make one proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite like themſelues, and when they haue made him, hee prooues <hi>duplo plus filues Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hennae, quam erat prius,</hi> two folde more the ſonne of perdition then he was before.</p>
            <p>Much better were it for ſuch, if they ſate ſtill, than ſo to ſeale vp iniquitie to theyr greater condemnation.</p>
            <p>Chriſt his trauell, and the trauell of the godly tendeth to a contray purpoſe: viz. to drawe men to the knowledge of the truth, and the gayning of ſoules to Chriſt. Such ſhall not looſe theyr labour. <hi>Hee that</hi>

               <hi>conuerteth ſoules.</hi> (ſaith Daniell) <hi>ſhall ſhine like the ſtarres for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet Dauid deſireth GOD to make him goe the path of his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and hauing learned to goe, hee ſtriueth to runne, <hi>I will runne the way of thy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal, 119, 32</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:3643:10"/> 
               <hi>commaundements when thou hast ſet my hart at libertie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the tenth of Marke, one comes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Zacheus beholding Chriſt out of the wilde Figge-tree, made haſt to get downe, and runnes to meete him.</p>
            <p>Bartymeus threw away his cloake to run to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the fourth of Micheas, the cry of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Iewes is noted: <hi>Come,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>let vs goe vp to the Mountaine, and to the houſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mica, 4, 2,</note> 
               <hi>of the God of Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the godlie are ſtill in motion: as Chriſt himſelfe is euer noted trauailing for the moſt part.</p>
            <p>VVe read neuer of his ſitting, but once, and then hee diſputed, teaching vs to ſhun idlenes. </p>
            <q>Hee drew neere the Cittie.</q>
            <p>The Bride cannot bee drawne from the Bridegroome, nor Chriſt from the citty.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of Canticles, vvee finde the Church the Spouſeſſe of Chriſt, running after Chriſt: <hi>I will runne after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 3. chapter, we finde her ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:3643:10"/> and diligently inquiring after Chriſt: <hi>Haue yee ſeene him whom my ſoule loueth?</hi> And in this place vvee finde Chriſt the Spouſe, ſeeking out his Spouſeſſe the Church; with like correſpondent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he trauaileth to viſit Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>Wherein, beſides his diligence, his loue and tender affection towardes the children of God is manifeſted. He cheriſheth them as his owne bowels, and therefore he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neere to Ieruſalem, as one deſirous to know theyr ſtate.</p>
            <p>Chriſt beeing borne in the Citty, couets to liue in the cittie. He came for mans ſake into the world, and ſo he liued in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of men 33. yeeres together. He came to call ſinners, and therefore he liued in the Citty, becauſe there were the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>We reade of Iohn Baptiſt, that hee liued <hi>in Deſerto,</hi> in the Wilderneſſe: he ſhrunke the cittie, for that the citty was full of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which Chriſt needed not to feare.</p>
            <p>Hee would liue in the cittie to winne the cittie: like an immaculate Lambe, he tooke away all ſpots from his elect.</p>
            <p>Hee vvoulde liue <hi>in Oculis Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3643:11"/> in the eyes of his aduerſaries, to the end hee might truly iuſtifie himſelfe. <hi>Quis exvobis arguat me de peccato,</hi> who of you can reprooue me of ſinne?</p>
            <p>Euery thing couets to liue at home, the byrds in the ayre, the fiſhes in the water, the beaſts in the mountaines: and Chriſt bred in the Citty, loueth the cittie, &amp; delights to viſit it. </p>
            <q>He drew neere to the cittie.</q>
            <p>More than this, it is added, <hi>hee beheld it.</hi> In 104. pſalme it is ſayd; <hi>A vertente faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em tuam, omnia turbabuntur,</hi> when thou tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt away thy face, all thinges are troubled. To ſhew that they are bleſſed vpon whom Chriſt looketh.</p>
            <p>Happy had theſe people beene, if they had as carefully looked vppon Chriſt, as Chriſt did vpon them: for then they had beene healed, as they that looked vpon the brazen Serpent recouered.</p>
            <q>Hee beheld.</q>
            <p>That is, in a carefull contemplation hee conſidered the great corruptions wherwith this cittie was ſtayned: and withall, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a prophetical eye vpon the ſeuere iudgements which God already had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb facs="tcp:3643:11"/> to throw vpon the citty, for the ſins therein committed.</p>
            <p>In this example two ſorts of men are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon, that is, Miniſters &amp; Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Miniſters ought to viſit the places moſt ſinfull. They muſt cry out againſt the ſins of the people. Eſ. 5.</p>
            <p>They muſt be knowne by theyr teaching and preaching, as Aarons entering into the Sanctuarie was knowne by the ſounde of <note place="margin">Exo. 28. 35.</note> the belles which he wore in the skirts of his clothing.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates are likewiſe called vpon, for Chriſt was both <hi>Rex et Propheta,</hi> a King &amp; a Prophet. They may not ſlumber vvhen iniquitie is increaſed, but they alſo muſt come and viſit Ieruſalem: that is, they muſt ſee the diſorders of citties and townes, and labour to reforme them.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath in his owne perſon chaulked the way before vs, and other godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in all ages haue ſucceeded him vvith like holy practize.</p>
            <p>Moſes, the perfect mirror of ſincere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie, did looke into the abuſes of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in his time, and laboured carefully to reforme the ſame. And for that hee coulde
<pb facs="tcp:3643:12"/> not alone vndergoe ſo waighty a prouince, by the aduice of Iethro his Father in lawe, Gods counſell alſo concurring, hee choſe vnto himſelfe other inferiour Magiſtrates
<note place="margin">Exod, 18. 21.</note> to be Rulers and Iudges, and there hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth what manner of men they ought to be. viz.</p>
            <p>Men of courage, fearing God, dealing <note place="margin">What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men Magiſtrates ought to be.</note> truly, hating couetouſnes. But I am not to ſpeake of this, but in a generalitie.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates muſt learne of Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thoſe places ouer which GOD hath made them ouerſeers. They muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theyr circuites come to Citties, and townes, but they muſt circumſpectly looke into the diſorders there.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt came within a ſight of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, he makes there his reſt, his ſtation: and there deliberatly in this his proſpect, he ſummoneth &amp; arraigneth at the bar of his iuſtice, all the ſinnes of the people of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
            <p>To behold then in this place, importeth not a ſlender looking into matters of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as the faſhion is of many Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that carry no conſcience of their places, ſuch as was Corah &amp; his complices,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:12"/> that could ſmooth vp the matter to Moſes with this warme conceit: <hi>All is well, and the people are holy enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this intimateth a diligent and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeculation, a due examination of all matters, both of ſmaller crimes and greater offences; and when they haue founde out the ſinner, as Ioſuah founde out Achan the theefe, &amp; his theft alſo, then to puniſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the weight of the offence.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates iudiciall cenſures muſt not be like Spyders webs, which intangle onely the ſmall flies.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt paſſed firſt from Beth-phage to Bethany, and from Bethany to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſo ſhoulde Magiſtrates paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſinnes to greater enormities, till all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes be abandoned: without which due ſpeculatiue courſes, nothing can be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in any wel ordered Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates ought to haue <hi>Lynceos oculos,</hi> to bee Eagle-ſighted, the better to looke into abuſes.</p>
            <p>They muſt be able to iudge of ſinne, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus et in cute,</hi> to make a ſcruting into euery corner of corruption, that no ſinne may eſcape without his cenſure.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:13"/>
            <p>They muſt rather ſhewe themſelues ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and ſtraight, like vnto Moſes and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuah in the puniſhing of ſinne, than too ſlacke and remiſſe in theyr places, like Ely, who ſpared to correct the diſobedience of his ſonnes: and ſo God tooke the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">1. Sam. 4.</note> into his owne hands, and ſpared not to cut off both him and them in the ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates muſt remember that they are the Lords Vize-gerents, in Gods ſled appoynted for the puniſhment of euill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and for the prayſe of them that do wel.</p>
            <p>The Phyloſophers lay downe three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a good eye: that is, To ſee quick. To ſee long. To ſee farre.</p>
            <p>Like Balaam, to ſee the vtmoſt coaſts of Iſraell, euen from Dan to Beerſhebath.</p>
            <p>They are not ſound Politicians nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly learned in the Arte Speculatiue, that doe not in this ſort behold abuſes.</p>
            <p>They carry not in them the ſubſtance of magiſtracie, till they haue learned to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the edge of theyr authority in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offences.</p>
            <p>As the Spirituall ſworde hath two edges, ſo the temporall or ciuil ſword ſhould haue
<pb facs="tcp:3643:13"/> two edges, to cut two wayes.</p>
            <p>In the foure-ſcore and ſecond pſalme, <hi>I haue ſaid yee are Gods,</hi> ſaith Dauid, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the perſon of God. As if hee ſhould haue ſaide, During the time of your magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, while you ſit in Gods chayre, you muſt forget that you are men, leaſt ſo baſe a conceit doe make you yeeld to weaknes, and corruption, but you are for that tyme more then men. You are Gods, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider of your places, Behold and puniſh. Looke into the nature of the ſin, and let the puniſhment be aunſwerable.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe, you are not like Gods, more than in your names and titles, as Labans I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols were called gods, and yet were but blocks.</p>
            <p>If Magiſtrates, when they ſhall aſcend theyr iudiciall ſeates did but conſider of this, theyr very names would teach them how to carry themſelues, and then woulde not ſinne ſo violently breake out, nor walk in the open ſtreets ſo vncontroled as at this day it doth.</p>
            <p>As no halt, nor lame, nor blinde, might be admitted into the Miniſtery, ſo vnto the Magiſtracie ſhould no weake, or corrupt,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:14"/> or blinde Magiſtrate be preferred: but the wiſeſt and beſt approued. </p>
            <q>It followeth, <hi>He wept for it.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>When Chriſt beheld the monſtrous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, and horrible ſinnes in this citty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without any hope of ſpeedie refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or amendement, it greeued him to the very hart, as once it greeued God his Father, when looking vpon the ſins of the old world, hee repented that hee had made man. And when he had once entered into this griefe, he could not chuſe but expreſſe the ſame by teares that flowed amaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eyes in great aboundance, like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Hesbon.
<note place="margin">Cant. 7. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hee wept partly for theyr ſinnes, partlie for the iudgements of God, which now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready were begun to be poured out.</p>
            <p>Saint Bernard principally noteth three things in Chriſt our Sauiour: <hi>Dicta conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis,</hi> words of conſolation. <hi>Opera propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiationis,</hi> works of propitiation. <hi>Facta com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerationis,</hi> deeds of commiſeration or pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as in this place, and elſwhere.</p>
            <p>We read that he wept thrice, once when he raiſed Lazarus: in this place vpon Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: and vpon the croſſe.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:14"/> Yet, we are not to thinke but that hee wept more often. For he did alwaies with teares no doubt lament the wickednes of men, to teach vs not to glory in our neighbors fall, but to weep &amp; bewaile their fraile co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition.</p>
            <p>Cyprian hath a ſweet ſaying: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ere pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, qui compatitur:</hi> He is moſt patient, that is moſt paſſionate. Or rather, he hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enough in him, that hath in him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. And it argueth a moſt Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and charitable affection, when we are in a pittifull remorſe touched with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns infirmities.</p>
            <p>Such was Moſes his compaſſion in the 25. of Numbers. And Paule, when he wept 3. yeeres for the Corinthians. And Eſdras for the afflicted Iewes.</p>
            <p>Heere by Chriſtes teares we are to learne three things. Firſt, that hee was a man like others, ſin onely excepted: which confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the hereſie of the Manichees, which do deny his humanity. For they holde that Chriſt was not <hi>verus homo,</hi> but <hi>quaſi homo,</hi> not very man, but in the ſimilitude of a man; and that he had not <hi>corpus,</hi> but <hi>quaſi corpus.</hi> viz. <hi>corpus aſſumptinum,</hi> not a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, but an aſſumptiue body.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:15"/>
            <p>In maintaining whereof they croſſe that Scripture: <hi>Hee was made of the ſeede of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid according to the fleſh.</hi> Rom. 1. 3. <hi>The word was made fleſh.</hi> Iohn. 1. 14. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>We haue but one Mediatour, euen the man Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them but aske the deuill in this caſe, and hee (although the father of lyes) vvill ſpeake truth heerein, to conuince them the rather of hereſie. Caſt thy ſelfe downe head-long, <hi>Mute te deorſum</hi> ſayth hee to Chriſt. The deuill is better then the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, for he acknowledgeth that Chriſt had a body, which they denie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that wee learne by his Teares, is, hee was vnwilling that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſraell ſhould commit ſinne, againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that moſt blaſphemouſly affirme that God is the Authour of ſinne. <hi>Volens, Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens, Suggerens.</hi> Croſſing theſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p>A prophane Writer, that neuer ſawe the light of Diuititie, could confute ſuch here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall opinions.</p>

            <p>Neither muſt wee imagine that God is the Author of euill, neither yet without God
<pb facs="tcp:3643:15"/> can any euill be done. For the ſpirit of God hath ſpoken it, <hi>Non eſt malum in Ciuitate, quod non facit Dominus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, by Chriſtes weeping we learne the ſympathie and holie vnion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and vs. Hee feeleth our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and is touched with our infirmities.</p>
            <p>We read of his ſighing in Marks goſpel, <note place="margin">Mark. 7. 34.</note> when he cured one that was deafe, &amp; heere wee reade of his weeping ouer Ieruſalem, that had in it many deafe eares, and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the voyce of the Charmer.</p>
            <p>Of the neceſſity of weeping, and howe farre teares may preuaile with God, beeing powred out from the eyes of the godlie, I haue plentifully ſpoken elſwhere.</p>
            <p>Thus much then ſhall briefely ſuffice, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſtes weeping vpon Ieruſalem. Now let vs proceede by order of the Text to the cauſe of his weeping. </p>
            <q>O, if thou hadst knowne. &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Ieruſalems ſinnes prouoked Chriſtes teares, and of theyr many ſinnes one is here diſcouered: <hi>They knew not theyr peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The learned doe expound peace three waies: eyther it may ſignifie Externall or outward peace: or peace of conſcience: or
<pb facs="tcp:3643:16"/> Chriſt, the Authour of peace.</p>
            <p>Ye may admit any of theſe ſignifications in this place, but in my iudgement the laſt is fitteſt, and moſt ſpecially meant by our Sauiour in this check, when hee told them, They knewe not that which belonged to their peace. Which had they knowne, it had brought them to the knowledge of all the reſt. They knewe not Chriſt by the preaching of the word, they receiued not the Goſpell of peace. They yeelded no obedience to the worde of truth, nor did ſhewe any carefull practiſe in reforming their liues accordingly.</p>
            <p>Theſe people of Ieruſalem liued in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and at eaſe, they liued in peace, euery man vnder his owne Vine, and vnder his own fig-tree. And they ſoothed vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in this their ſecuritie: aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that this great citty, beeing the Lady of ſo many Prouinces, the light and beauty of all Aſia, and all kings glory, ſo ſtrongly ſortifyed, ſo richly furniſhed, and vvith ſo many people repleniſhed, ſhould neuer bee brought to vtter deſolation.</p>
            <p>Such is the naturall corruption of men, generally to be careleſſe, and not once to
<pb facs="tcp:3643:16"/> thinke or aduiſe themſelues of future cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, ſo long as it goeth well with them: ſo long as they are fatted with the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gods bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Theſe inhabitants of Ieruſalem were not ſo prouident, nor ſo wiſe as the prophane Phyloſophers, notwithſtanding, they liued then when wiſedome cryed in their ſtreets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sapientis eſt in otio de negotio cogitare,</hi> a wiſe man ought in time of peace to think vpon warre.</p>
            <p>So is it verifyed vvhich vvas ſpoken by our Sauiour: <hi>The chyldren of this world are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke, 16, 8.</note> 
               <hi>wiſer in theyr generation then the chyldren of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe careleſſe Iewes abuſed their peace, becauſe they ſought no meanes to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue it: For they killed the Prophets, and ſtoned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were ſent vnto them: Yea, when Chriſt himſelfe came among them, they crucified him, to ſeale vp theyr ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to theyr greater ouerthrow.</p>
            <p>And howe then could this people know theyr peace, vvhen they contemned and euill intreated him that was the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and maintainer of theyr peace?</p>
            <p>Thys Peace, contayneth in it all other
<pb facs="tcp:3643:17"/> bleſſings. And therefore Chriſt onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it in this place, as the very continent of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>The excellencie whereof may appeare in thoſe ſpeciall commendations of it. Before his departure hee commended vnto them Peace. <hi>My peace I leaue vnto you.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk, 24, 36</note>
            </p>
            <p>When he was riſen againe hee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded peace: &amp; vpon his byrth-day the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels proclaimed peace: and the Goſpell is <note place="margin">Luke, 2, 14</note> called the Goſpell of peace. Therfore haue peace, and thou haſt all the bleſſings that God hath: and want onely this peace, and thou art worſe ſpoiled of Gods graces, than euer was Iob of his chyldren and goods.</p>
            <q>Oh, if thou hadst knowne, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Here it may be proclaimed againe, which once was vttered by that voyce of maieſtie proceeding from God himſelfe in the 34. of Exodus, <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and gracious, ſlowe to anger, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in mercy and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See howe Chriſt our Sauiour trauaileth with mercy in this place, and laboureth to be deliuered. <hi>Oh, if thou hadst knowne.</hi> Yet, hee offereth mercy to Ieruſalem, if Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem would haue repented.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:17"/>
            <p>Oh that yet they would turne, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Shall I ſay, ſince they will perriſh, let them perriſht nay ſurely, ſaith Chriſt, I will yet waſh Naaman ſeauen times more, to clenſe him of his leproſie, if hee vvill be clenſed.</p>
            <p>In the 51. of Ieremie &amp; ninth verſe, ſaith the Lorde, <hi>I woulde haue cured Babell:</hi> So Chriſt in this place ſaith: I would haue cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Ieruſalem, but alas, ſhe will not be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. All the precious balme in Gylead will not ſuffice to recouer Ieruſalem, the prayſe of the world. </p>
            <q>In this thy day.</q>
            <p>He calls it Ieruſalems day: to ſhewe that God giueth all men a time; and now is our day, and our time: therefore vſe the time, and abuſe not Gods lenitie. <hi>For the night will come, when no man can worke.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſayde, <hi>To day, if you will heare his voyce.</hi> But if you will not to day, I will not to morrow. Beholde, as when I called, you woulde not heare, ſo when you call, I vvill not heare, ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>A day conſiſts but of a morning, an eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a noone: and hee that hath the longeſt time permitted him, hath but a day.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:18"/> Defer it not then in any caſe, ſince thy time in which thou maiſt turne to God is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſcantled.</p>
            <p>If thou loſe the morning of thy life, loſe not the noone: and if thou be ſo careleſſe a ſinner, as that thou putteſt off thy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion till the euening of thy life, yet euen then reclaime thy ſelfe, before the ſunne of Righteouſnes doe ſet, when it can ſhine no more vnto thee.</p>
            <p>But thou ſhalt haue a happier ſucceſſe in my iudgement, if thou begin betimes, like Abraham, in the morning of thy life, to ſacrifice thy ſelfe to GOD. For wee haue an old ſaying, &amp; it is a true ſaying: A good beginning makes a good ending. And <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Euery man would be gladde to die vvell, as Balaam deſired to die the death of the righteous, but hee had no care to lyue the life of the righteous. And therfore, though he could prophecie to others, yet hee could not prophecie to himſelfe, nor ſore-ſee his owne end.</p>
            <p>Farre otherwiſe did Dauid that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall King carry himſelfe, and may ſtande
<pb facs="tcp:3643:18"/> as a rare preſident, not for Kinges onelie, but for priuate men alſo: he began his day betimes, and ſo continued it to the end. <hi>At euening, morning, and at noone will I prayſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 55. 17.</note> 
               <hi>thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thys forſlowing the time, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all running on in ſin, making vp the ſcore of iniquitie, is heere imbrayded vnto theſe Iewes.</p>
            <p>The tyme of grace was offered them, the time of viſitation, vvhen the Lorde called vpon them for repentance, but they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not. The Turtle, the Crane, and the Swallowe, knowe theyr appoynted times, yet Iſraell knoweth not his time.</p>
            <p>God ſent his Worde, they neglected it, his Prophets, them they ſlewe, his ovvne Sonne, and him they crucified. Still they were careleſſe, like the olde worlde before the flood. And ſo GOD ſhut them out of Tyme, for that vvhen they had Time, they abuſed the commoditie thereof in the world.</p>
            <p>If theſe people had conſidered of theyr peace, they had not prouoked Chriſtes eyes to diſtill into teares: But as faſt as Chriſt drevve them forwardes, ſinne and
<pb facs="tcp:3643:19"/> ſathan drew them backwards: euer-more ſounding in their eares this ſo pleaſing and ſo plauſible a leſſon, It is not yet time, time is not yet.</p>
            <p>See howe continuance of ſinne breedes cuſtome, &amp; when cuſtome entereth, Gods grace auoydeth, and ſo the Temple of God becomes a denne of theeues.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Conſuetudo peccandi tollit ſenſum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati:</hi> Cuſtome in ſinne, takes away al ſence and feeling of ſinne: and ſo beeing once paſt ſence and feeling, the body becomes dead, without motion, life or ſoule in it.</p>
            <p>Note the degrees of ſinne in ſinfull men, firſt they grow wicked, then obſtinate, then deſperate, like Caine, poſting it from one ſinne to another, at laſt a griping worme of conſcience ſeazeth vpon theyr ſoules, as the deuils entered into the heard of Swine. And then they cry out in a deſperate rage: <hi>Whoſoeuer findes me, ſhall ſley me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Genc. 4. 14,</note>
            </p>
            <p>Not much different from this, is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the learned, wherein they make foure degrees of a ſinner. The firſt, in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary delectation. The ſecond, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent. The third, in fulfilling it by worke. The fourth, in continuance. VVherein whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="tcp:3643:19"/> is once buried, is hardly raiſed to life againe without earneſt prayer vnto God, &amp; many teares on his owne behalfe.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Languor prolixior grauat medicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> but <hi>languorem breuem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit medicus:</hi> A long vlcerat ſore troubles the Phiſition, but a greene wound is eaſilie launced.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>Tut now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This call of Chriſt in this place, was as it were the third Cocke to warne theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to repent.</p>
            <p>The ſinner cannot ſay, but he hath been called. Herod had a call, when Iohn prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto him. That other Herode had a call, when he felt a deſire to ſee Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What a call had Pilat, when he was made to vnderſtand the innocencie of Chriſt. And ſo Ieruſalem had a call, &amp; that a loud call by Chriſt himſelfe, preaching vnto them euery day in theyr Temple, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo many miracles before them, which made Chriſt vtter with weeping eyes, thys ſentence ſo full of ſweet compaſſion, <hi>Oh, if thou hadst knowne, at least in this thy day, thoſe things that belong vnto thy peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:20"/>
            <p>Now I come to particular application, &amp; ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>When we come to our citties &amp; townes, as Chriſt came to Ieruſalem: &amp; do cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie behold (as we cannot chuſe but ſee) the manifolde pollutions, and ſinnes in them committed, haue not we cauſe to take vp a lamentation, and to weepe for our Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem of England, together with our other Citties and Townes: and may not vvee as iuſtly proclaime with Chriſt in this place: <hi>Oh, if you had knowne, at least now in this your day, the things that belong to your peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVee are as ſinfull as euer the men of Ieruſalem vvere. Nay, our ſinnes exceede theyrs, both in quantitie, qualitie, number, and nature, euery way beyonde compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; And may not our eyes then ſtreame foorth teares, for that vvee are they that do not knovv nor regarde the day of our viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſſolute Iewes liued ſecurely, too too much preſuming vpon Gods long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerance and lenitie. Beſides, for that they had the Temple of God amongſt them, &amp; the Arke of his Couenaunt, which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bleſſing and life for euer-more, they
<pb facs="tcp:3643:20"/> waxed the more careleſſe, &amp; miſtruſted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Yet more then all this, they truſted in the ſtrength of their citty, &amp; in the wiſe gouernment of theyr ſage Senators, and in the multitude of theyr horſes &amp; Chariots. But all deceaued them, to iuſtifie the truth of that Scripture, <hi>Curſed is hee that maketh fleſh his arme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, the Emperour Titus himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, it had been a thing in humaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon impoſſible to ouercome it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ieremie confirming the ſame. The Kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not haue beleeued that the aduerſary and the enemy, ſhould haue entred into the gates of Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>But theyr falſe confidence deceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, GOD had ſo diſpoſed, that euen at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when there came infinite multitudes from all places to Ieruſalem to worſhip the Citty ſhould then be beſieged. And there were gathered together at one tyme, about thirty hundred thouſand, as Ioſephus teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</p>
            <p>In that bloody ſtratageme ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands left theyr liues, that it greeued the very enemies that came to take it: And it
<pb facs="tcp:3643:21"/> was commaunded by the Emperour vpon view of the dead bodies, that ſo many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained aliue, ſhould not bee ſlaine, but be ſold. And the reſidue of the Iewes were had in ſo vile a reckoning, that thirtie of them were valued but at one penny: as they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued Chriſt our Lorde but at thirty ſiluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſo God in his iuſt iudgement, prized thirtie of them to be woorth but one ſiluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that to be a coyne of the ſmalleſt value. Moſt Writers hold it to be but a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>And at this day they are accounted the moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible nation in the world Yea, the very name of a Iewe is odious, and it is not ſo much as once mentioned vvithout diſdaine.</p>
            <p>And thus was Ieruſalem defaced: thus were the peculiar people of God become no people, &amp; the citty that once was <hi>Shem,</hi> the glory of the world, nowe become the ſhame of the world, wherein may not bee found one ſtone vpon a ſtone, becauſe they regarded not to know the day of theyr vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</p>
            <p>So it pleaſed the moſt iuſt <hi>Iehouah</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge that place, where our Lord was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:21"/> and where the blood of Gods ſaints was ſpilt vpon the ground like water.</p>
            <p>Hence let vs grow wiſe, and learne by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems fall to ſtand. Let the ſhrubs trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when the tall Cedar trees are throwne downe.</p>

            <p>Neuer did ſo many Prophets cry at once in our ſtreets, as at this day they do throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Land, from Dan to Beerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, from Douer to Saint Dauys, from Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke to the Mount, Court, Citty, and Country: but who doth liſten to the voyce of the Cryer?</p>
            <p>Neuer was the vvorde more plentifullie taught, neuer more contemptuouſly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, neuer more talking of it, but neuer leſſe walking after it: many that can ſpeak well, too too fewe that can doe well.

            <p>Therefore, while the kingdome of grace is with vs, let vs holde it, leaſt in deſpyſing it, wee loſe a better Paradice than Adam did.</p>
            <p>VVee liue in that age wherein wee may beholde the ſtarre-bright cleerenes of that glory, and the fulneſſe of that peace which the Kings of the earth, &amp; the mighty men before vs haue deſired to ſee, but might not attaine vnto it: all which doth agrauat our ſinnes the more: for by howe much more plentifully GOD ſhines among vs in his graces, by ſo much the ſorer-will our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be.</p>
            <p>For if the Worde, when it was ſpoken by Angels, was ſtedfaſt: and euery tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and diſobedience receiued a iuſt recompence of reward: howe ſhall vvee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape if vvee neglect ſo great ſaluation, which was firſt preached by the Lord him

            <p>Pyndarus writeth, that it was counted a happy Citty on the which it was thought that golde did raine. If any Citty bee ſo, then hath God poured this bleſſing vppon vs and our Citties of England, in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meaſure.</p>
            <p>It is ſeene in the wealth, the peace, and godly ſecuritie that wee haue nowe a long time inioyed.

            <p>Euery good man weigh with himſelfe the long tranquility, great plenty, peaceable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which God hath giuen vs, during the raigne of our moſt gracious Soueraign, making our daies like the daies of <hi>Salomon,</hi> in whoſe time ſiluer was as plentifull as <note place="margin">2.

Theſe ſo great bleſſings from her deriued vnto vs, ought in no wiſe to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for they are indeed for number ſo many, &amp; for valew ſo
<pb facs="tcp:3643:23"/> great, as the like haue not beene ſeene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in any age. Firſt, in hauing the true light of the Goſpell ſo ſhining among vs: ſo publiquely receiued; ſo vniuerſally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; ſo freely preached. Againe, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs a Prince ſo vertuous borne among vs, with ſuch peace defending vs, againſt them that would deuour vs: vvhat coulde God doe more for his Vineyard then hee hath done? ſo that wee may ſing with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, <hi>Peace is within our gates, and plenteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe within our Palaces.</hi> And againe, <hi>Mercy and truth haue met together, righteouſnes and peace haue kiſſed each other.</hi> And again, <hi>Non eſt auditus Armorum ſonitus in vrbe.</hi>

            <p>That may be truly ſpoken of vs, vvhich Zephany coulde not iuſtifie of the people in his time. Our Princes are not as roaring Lyons, our Iudges are not like rauening VVolues, that leaue not the bones till the morrowe. Our Prophets are not light and wicked perſons, polluting the Sanctuarie, and wreſting the law. The iuſt GOD is in the midſt of vs, he will doe no iniquitie.</p>
            <p>So many England ſeeme (theſe infinite bleſſings that I haue ſpoken of duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) like Eden the pleaſant garden plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Since God hath performed theſe great things for vs, which no tongue of man or Angell is ſufficiently able to eternize, let vs be thankfull, and let our gratitude be teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our obedience, leaſt it be ſaide of vs that Ieruſalem is no better then Samaria.</p>
            <p>When Iacob in the 28. of Geneſis avva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of his ſleepe at Bethel, hee ſayde, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So if, when God ſhall teſtifie his preſence among vs, in his manifold bleſſings, and we take no notice of it in acknowledging ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him nor them: we may well ſay as Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob did: <hi>Of a ſurety God was in this place, &amp; we were not aware.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs acknowledge them now wee haue them, for it will be too late when they ſhall be taken from vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bring forth fruites</hi> (ſaith Iohn) <hi>woorthy of repentance.</hi> So bring forth good works wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of theſe bleſſings. Wee would all ſeeme to be hanged with leaues. let vs rather ſhew that we are hanged with fruites, leaſt we be like the fruiteleſſe Figge-tree; leaſt wee be like Chorazin &amp; Beth-ſaida where Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:3643:24"/> wrought many miracles, yet they remained faithleſſe.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you brethren in the bowels of Ieſus Chriſt, make much of the Worde which is preached among you: for it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen your life. So termed by Moſes in the 32. of Deut.</p>
            <p>If you will haue a care of your peace, if you will haue Chriſtes eyes to diſtil with no teares: if you will not greeue the Spirit of God, by whom yee are ſealed to the day of redemption. let Ieruſalems ruine be to you a cauſe of riſing. This profit ſhoulde bee made of others harmes, like the honny that Sampſon found in the dead Lyon.</p>
            <p>Oh that this heere threatned to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, were written vppon the tables of our harts with an yron penne, or the poynt of a Dyamant, that it might neuer be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Oh that we would yet learne to know our peace, and the time of our viſitation.</p>
            <p>Yet there is time to conſider our ſelues, yet is the acceptable time, yet is the day of ſaluation, yet the Sunne of righteouſnes ſhineth, &amp; God calleth to the waters of life. Yet hee cryeth in our eares. <hi>Be lifted vp yee gates, and I will enter in,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and

            <p>I end in a word with this ſhort exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As when God made the light, and had it from the darknes, he ſayd, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num est,</hi> it is good. When he had made the firmament, the earth and the ſeas, he ſayd: <hi>bonum est,</hi> it is good. When hee had made the trees, hearbes, and plants, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hee ſaid ſtill <hi>bonum est,</hi> it is good. But hauing finiſhed his work of creation, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a perfect view of al that he had made, finding that all things did agree &amp; ſute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, after a kind of heauenly harmony, and more then Geometricall proportion, then he pronounced, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alde bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est,</hi> it was exceeding good. So when good &amp; profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lawes ſhall be eſtabliſhed among vs, it may be ſaid, <hi>bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt.</hi> When Magiſtrats mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter righteous iudgements, dealing truly &amp; vprightlie in their offices, it may be ſaid: <hi>bonum est,</hi> it is good.</p>
            <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Miniſter preacheth the word of
<pb facs="tcp:3643:25"/> truth in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, and the people doe diligently heare, and reforme theyr liues accordingly, it may be ſayd, <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt.</hi> But when there ſhall be a muſicall conſent as it were, and a mutuall harmonie of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And all this will bee eaſily brought to paſſe, if wee doe but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of our peace.</p>
            <p>Now the very God of peace ſanctifie vs throughout: &amp; I pray God that our ſoules and bodies may be kept blameleſſe to the comming of our Lord Ieſus.</p>

            <p>And theſe buyers and ſellers heere, caſt
<pb facs="tcp:3643:27"/> out by our Sauiour Chriſt, entered the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but not for any holy practiſe to pray, or praiſe God in it, but to pollute it and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it, in making the houſe of God a ſhop of merchandize.</p>
            <p>In all theſe wicked men there vvas not found deuotion, but pollution, vncleannes of hart. Sinfulneſſe had ſo poſſeſſed them, that they ſeemed to haue ſolde themſelues to worke impietie, like Ahab. But thys their monſtrous ſacriledge &amp; horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of Gods Temple, eſcaped not vnpuniſhed. For in the ſame place where theyr faultes are mentioned, their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are likewiſe recorded.</p>
            <p>Antiochus was ſtriken with a remedileſſe payne in his bowels, and he died moſt loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly: the wormes iſſuing out of his bodie in great abundance.</p>
            <p>Nicanor was the firſt man that was ſlaine in the battell, after the Armies had met. His head and right hand were ſmitten off, and hanged vpon the gates of Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>Belſhazar in the prime of his pride, and when he was moſt merry, carowſing vvine in his golden veſſels, was ſtriken to a dump when he ſaw the hideous hande vppon the
<pb facs="tcp:3643:27"/> wall, penning his tragicall end, and ruine of his kingdome. That night was Belſhazer ſlaine, and forced to reſigne at once both life and kingdome.</p>
            <p>So as the wicked plow vpon Gods backe large &amp; long furrowes, the furrowes of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: ſo God alſo ploweth vppon theyr backs, he trampleth vpon them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and this will hee doe to all them that ſeeke to diſhonour GOD, by ſtabliſhing theyr owne honour. To iuſtifie that which the propheticall King hath publiſhed long agoe: <hi>Surely God will ariſe, and his enemies ſhall be ſcattered, they alſo that hate him, ſhall flee before him. As the ſmoake vaniſheth, ſo ſhalt thou driue them away, and as the waxe melteth before the fire, ſo ſhall the wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at the preſence of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs then betimes aduiſe our ſelues: by theſe mens falls to learne to ſtand, and by theyr puniſhments to hate their ſinnes, leaſt wee be ouer-taken with the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This leſſon ought we to learne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the ſinners ſchoole: and thus ſhould we from other mens ſinnes deriue inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our ſelues, as Salomon did to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the 24. of the Prouerbs, vvhen hee
<pb facs="tcp:3643:28"/> paſſed by the fields of the ſlothfull, &amp; ſawe it all couered with weedes.</p>
            <p>Let vs know then, that if deuotion call vs not hether, our entrance is in vaine. If the Phariſee when he entered into the Temple had carried with him deuotion, as he caried pride with him when he iuſtified himſelfe, hee had not loſt that which the publican found, to teach vs to come as the publican, that is in humilitie, if we will find mercy.</p>
            <p>Many come to the Temple, but fewe come as they ſhould: as a number in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes time came to the Sinagoues to ſee him, and to heare him, but yet fewe there vvere that drew fayth and deuotion from him, as the woman drew vertue from him by tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching but his hem. Herod deſired to ſee Chriſt, but it was for that hee looked that Chriſt ſhould worke ſome miracle before him. In another place wee read of vvhole companies following him, but not for the doctrine he taught them, but rather for the bellies ſake, as they that ſayd, <hi>Rabby, vvhen cammeſt thou hether?</hi> The Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſlocked to the temple to heare Chriſt preach, but it was to intangle hym in his words.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:28"/>
            <p>So is it nowe with vs, all will come to the Temple, all will preſent themſelues, ſome for feare of lawe, ſome in hypocriſie vvill come, becauſe they will pretend a ſhewe of religion, and ſo bee reputed as honeſt men as any within theyr neighbourhood; other for faſhion ſake, few or none for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience will preſent themſelues to the Lord in pure deuotion, as Chriſt did here.</p>
            <p>The note of inſtruction then to be raiſed from this example of Chriſt is this. VVee muſt learne how to enter into Gods Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that our ſeruice and miniſtery there, when we come may be accepted.</p>
            <p>For as Paule ſaid to the Philippians, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny walke, of whom I haue tolde you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the Croſſe of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So may it be ſayd, That many enter into the Temple of GOD, as if they were the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt. Like the buyers and ſellers in this place, that entered in, both to corupt themſelues, &amp; the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Hee that will enter then as hee ought, muſt firſt conſider of the place vvhether hee preſſeth.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:29"/> It is the Temple: more then that, it is Gods Temple; nay yet more, it is Gods houſe, the place where God dwelleth, and it is the very Arke of his preſence: and vnto it hath hee appoynted bleſſing and life for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>Wee ſeeke men commonly at theyr hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for there is theyr continuall dwelling: So if wee will finde God, wee muſt ſeeke him at his houſe, as Ioſeph and Mary did: his houſe is the Temple.</p>
            <p>So then, both in regard of the place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we come, and of the perſon to whom we come, wee are to bee armed with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>Iacob found the Angell in Bethell, and wee muſt come to Bethell before wee can finde the Angell, that is, Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt free our ſelues from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before we enter in hether, &amp; the means to effect that, is by aduiſing our ſelues of the place and perſon.</p>
            <p>In the fift of Exodus, when God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Moſes, hee called the place <hi>Terram ſanctam,</hi> a holy place, and hee might not tread vppon it, till firſt hee had put off his ſhooes: and ſo we muſt put off our ſhooes
<pb facs="tcp:3643:29"/> of carnalitie before we enter into this holie place. In the 28. of Geneſis, when God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Iacob, he called the place <hi>Terram terribilem,</hi> a fearefull place: ſo the Temple of God is alſo a fearefull place: it is both fearefull and holy. It is a terrible place to them that make no conſcience howe they enter in, vvith vncircumcized hearts and hands. For to ſuch God is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuming fire, as he conſumed Nadab and Abihu, euen in the Temple, making of a place of refuge a place of terror: for that they regarded not with what fire theyr ſacrifice was kindled.</p>
            <p>But it is a holy place to them that come in holines, and deuotion; to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as Moſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelfe before hee aduentured to come neere the flaming buſh.</p>
            <p>In the 40. of Exodus, Aaron &amp; his ſons might not enter into the Sanctuary vvith vnwaſhen hands, nevther might they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the Prieſtes office, but in theyr holy garments. Why then we muſt knowe that ſomewhat is to be doone, before wee enter into Gods Sanctuary, before wee preſume to preſſe into the preſence of GOD, wee muſt prepare our ſelues, &amp; we muſt cleuſe
<pb facs="tcp:3643:30"/> our ſoules from all corruption, wee muſt purifie firſt our owne temples, our bodies, and ſoules: for it is ſayd, <hi>Estis vos templum Dei:</hi> your bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, therfore glorifie God in your bodies, &amp; in your ſoules, for they are Gods.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe, if this reuerent preparation be not made, well wee may thruſt in our ſelues among others into Gods Temple, like as theſe buyers and ſellers intruded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but we haue no comfort in ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and wee muſt looke to be throwne out, as they were, and as the vnworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the mariage of the Kings ſonne was caſt out, becauſe hee brought not with him <hi>vestem nuptialem,</hi> a wedding-garment.</p>
            <p>This is to come vnreuerently &amp; vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily: and ſuch ſhall not bee accepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they offer vp the ſacrifice of fooles, as Salomon noteth. In the 22. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. no vncleane thing might enter into the new Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo no vncleane thing ſhould enter our bodies, our earthly Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>It is written of Abraham, that when hee went to ſacrifice his ſonne, he left his Aſſes at the foote of the hill: So when wee haue a purpoſe to ſacrifice our ſelues vnto God,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:30"/> wee muſt leaue our ſinnes and corruptions behind vs, as he did his aſſes.</p>
            <p>Our cares, and our corruptions may not enter in with vs, but wee muſt leaue them without, as a man leaues his ſhadowe at the doore when he enters into the houſe.</p>
            <p>Conſider when wee are going out from our houſes, we are going out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſelues, and from our vanities, and when vvee are come to the Temple, we are com to God: God &amp; our ſoules are heere met together, like Abraham &amp; Lazarus in the heauens.</p>
            <p>As the Iſraelites durſt not come to the Mount where God ſpake, till they had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their clothes, &amp; ſanctified themſelues, ſo may not we preſume to enter into Gods Temple, till wee haue waſhed our clothes, our menſtruous raggs of ſinfulnes; like the Spouſeſſe in the Canti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>les, who had vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her feete, and changed her rayments, when ſhe went to meet her Spouſe.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe it is ſaide; <hi>Keepe my Sabbath, &amp; reuerence my Sanctuary.</hi> And to this purpoſe wee haue our preparations before the Sabbath, which we call the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Eeue: and on the Sabbath, our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſacrifice, and our euening incenſe.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:31"/> Yea, and the bells that ſounde in our eares doe giue vs ſummons for this reuerence, as Aaron gaue notice of his entrance into the Sanctuarie by the ſounde of thoſe golden belles, which were faſtned to the skyrts of his robe.</p>
            <p>In a worde, not to make a long amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in ſo cleere a matter: by this ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt wee learne two things, firſt his godly care: ſecondly, the effect of his carefulnes.</p>
            <p>In this chapter tis eſpecially noted, that as ſoone as he came into the Citty, he made haſt to goe viſit the Temple. Wee doe not reade that he firſt entred into any houſe, to refreſh himſelfe, or to eaſe his body, beeing by all likelihoode ouer-wearied with long trauell: for he had come from Iericho, to Beth-phage, and to Bethany, and ſo to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
            <p>But all this notwithſtanding, to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hee goes, to teach vs principally to be carefull in the ſeruice of God, before vvee miniſter to our ſelues or other, in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this world. Wee muſt firſt ſerue God, and then our ſelues, as Eliah ſayde to the woman of Sarepſah: <hi>Bake mee a Cake
<pb facs="tcp:3643:31"/> firſt, and then after prepare for thee &amp; thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</hi> So vnto vs God ſaith; Firſt offer me a ſacrifice of holines, and than miniſter to thy ſelfe and thine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First ſeeke the kingdome of God, and the righteouſnes thereof:</hi> but we ſeeke our owne things firſt. Firſt wee ſerue the worlde and our luſts, and our vanities, and God is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued eyther not at all, or after all. After ſin, and after the word, and after the deuill.</p>
            <q>He entered into the Temple.</q>
            <p>In the Temple giue to GOD all holie worſhippe: there is the place where our Lampes ought to be continually burning, kindled with the fire of zeale &amp; deuotion. There ought wee to hold vp pure hands &amp; harts vnto God, prayſing him continuallie without ceaſing: and in pouring out infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Halle-lu-iahs,</hi> like thoſe Saints in the Reuelation, vnto him that was, and is, and is to come.</p>
            <p>This is called by our Sauiour. <hi>Vnum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium,</hi> that one neceſſary thing, and the <hi>Better part,</hi> which cannot be taken from vs. Chriſt was carefull, and hee was willing to viſit the Temple, for it was the firſt thing hee did after hee had ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te foote within the
<pb facs="tcp:3643:32"/> ſtreetes of Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>He that will ſerue God, muſt ſerue him willingly, we muſt come to the Church in a voluntarie affection, not by conſtraint, as doe the Church-papiſts in our age: For they enter in by compulſion, for feare of Lawe, and the Princes diſpleaſure, not for conſcience. Or if it bee loue that drawes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thither: it is the loue they beare to theyr houſes and lands, not for the loue they haue to Chriſt, or his Goſpell, whom they haue denyed, in denying his truth. Such mens roome is better then theyr company: and they goe forth as they cam in: onely a little water is ſprinckled, which preſently fals of, faſter then it lighted on.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they that like temporary men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſers do only ſerue the time to ſerue their turne, hoping whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time wil turne, that they may turne with time. Theſe ſerue God, as Nabucadnezars chaplains ſerued their idol god, <hi>God Bell,</hi> they ſerued Bell becauſe Bell ſerued their bellies; &amp; they ſeeme nowe to ſerue God, not the true God, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but a God whom their owne idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous conceits haue erected, another <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <pb facs="tcp:3643:32"/>
            <p>But wee (beloued) haue not ſo learned Chriſt: let vs rather ſticke to him, and ſay with the Apoſtles, <hi>Whether ſhal we goe, thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs learne to ſerue him willingly with alacritie and cheerefulnes, for as it is ſayd <hi>God loueth a cheerful giuer,</hi> ſo it may be ſaid, God loueth a cheerfull worſhipper.</p>
            <p>S. Paul in the 12. of Rom. 1. exhorteth vs <hi>to giue our bodies:</hi> in that hee calls it a gift, hee ſheweth a voluntary obedience. And where in the following wordes, hee ſaith; <hi>And faſhion not your ſelues like vnto the world:</hi> he iuſtifieth thereby, that indeede it is far from the faſhion of this world to giue our bodies vnto God: for the men of thys world are carnally minded, and doe take theyr bodies from God, and doe giue them to their luſts as the Iſralites gaue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Moloch. In the time of the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law we read, that among thoſe many offrings, ſome were called <hi>Free-will offrings,</hi> &amp; theſe were in greateſt requeſt with God. Look the 35. of Exod, how bountifully the people gaue, &amp; how gladly the lord accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: look the 29. of the 1. booke of chro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvhat a liberall offering is there recorded.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:33"/>
            <p>The Princes, and Captaines, and Rulers, gaue for the ſeruice of the houſe of God, fiue thouſand talents of gold, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of ſiluer, and of braſſe and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure. Yea, and they with whom precious ſtones were found, gaue them to the treaſure of the houſe of the Lord: and all this was doone willingly. For it is added in the ninth verſe, <hi>The people reioyced when they offered willingly, and with a perfect hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loe howe chargeable was the ſeruice of the Temple then, and none of theſe things doth God require of vs: Onely (ſaith hee) giue me thy hart; and yet we cannot afford to giue him but ſo much.</p>
            <p>Surely, wee ought not to with-holde it from him, for he hath deerely bought it, &amp; payde for it. And Paule witneſſeth the ſame: <hi>Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are bought with a price.</hi> It was a price indeede of greateſt value, more worth then all the Talents of gold before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Euen the hart-blood of the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſon in the world.</p>
            <p>And thus much ſhall briefely ſuffice for clearing the matter of ſubſtance contayned in theſe wordes of Chriſtes entrance into the Temple.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:33"/>
            <p>You haue hearde of Chriſtes deuotion, nowe ſhall you heare of his zeale. Where theſe two are met together, there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>As a Lampe cannot burne without oyle, ſo deuotion cannot bee kindled without zeale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee threw out them that bought. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere is ſhewed Chriſtes action, what he did vpon his entrance into the Church, he throwes out them that bought and ſold: wherein he ſhewes his regall authority.</p>
            <p>Chriſt entering into the Temple, findes the people there neyther praying nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, but chopping and changing, as if it were <hi>Forum,</hi> not <hi>Templum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is not co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>enient to make of the houſe of God a den of theeues: ſo is it not fit to make it a ſhop of merchandize.</p>
            <p>It was once ſayd, Where God hath his Church, the deuill hath his chappell: but nowe it may be ſayd, Where God hath his chappell, the deuill hath his church. Nay, God hath ſcarce a chappell.</p>
            <p>Theſe Merchants, theſe buyers and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in this place, poſſeſſe both church, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, chauncell and all. Euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the porch
<pb facs="tcp:3643:34"/> to the Altar, and to the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> all is deuided betweene theſe buyers &amp; ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: &amp; for the throng Chriſt is ſcarce able to haue roome to enter into the Temple.</p>
            <p>Of olde time it was eſtabliſhed, that it ſhould not be lawfull to carry ſo much as a veſſell through the Temple. Yet in this place, chapmen, buyers and ſellers moſt prophanely durſt intrude themſelues into Gods Church.</p>
            <p>Salomon had ſo great a care in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that magnificent Temple in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that he ſuffered nor, eyther hammer or axe, or any yron toole to be heard in the houſe, while it was in building.</p>
            <p>But this vngodly generation of buyers &amp; ſellers, feared not to pollute &amp; defile Gods Temple, with blaſphemous clamors, lowd cryings, idle talkings, and walkings, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and forſwearing: all which horrible and groſſe corruptions are wont to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that buy and ſell. Yea, &amp; this to be done in Gods houſe, and in Chriſtes preſence.</p>
            <p>Needes muſt Chriſt be grieued at thys ſight. This ſpectacle muſt needes make him looke about for his zeale, as Iob loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:3643:34"/> about for his patience after ſo manie heauie meſſages.</p>
            <p>No doubt as Noah was greeued with the ſinnes of the olde world, and Lot at the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes of the Sodomites: ſo it gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Chriſt our Lorde to finde in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this rout of wicked ones, abuſing the Temple of God with theyr moſt vngodly demeanure. </p>
            <q>But what doth Chriſt?</q>
            <p>Doth he ſhew himſelfe onely a looker on? and doth he make no ſpeed to reforme this intollerable outrage: yes hee beſtirres him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like a mightie Giant newly wakened out of a dreame: and hee clothes himſelfe with zeale as with a garment, and preſently proceedeth to purge the Temple of this wicked aſſembly. He throwes them out.</p>
            <p>In the third of Geneſis we reade, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as Adam had ſinned. God ſent his Angell to thruſt him out of Paradice: Heere was zeale.</p>
            <p>The Sodomites &amp; people of Gomorha ſinned, preſently God rained fire &amp; brym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from heauen to conſume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at once: and heere was zeale.</p>
            <p>Dauid ſinned in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bering the people, for
<pb facs="tcp:3643:35"/> which 70. thouſand loſt theyr liues: heere was zeale. Phineas in his zeale ſlew Zym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Cosby. And in this place GOD ſent his Sonne to puniſh the prophaners of his Temple.</p>
            <q>Hee cast them out.</q>
            <p>After ſinne comes reuenge, the heauieſt companion of wickednes. The ſinnes of Ieruſalem did once make Chriſtes eyes to diſtill into teares. There hee exerciſed his eyes expreſſing his great greefe, and heere theyr ſinnes made him exerciſe his handes, by throwing them out of the Temple, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his zeale.</p>
            <p>It is woorth the noting to conſider vvith what ſpeed Chriſt laboureth to reform the abuſes that had crept into his church.</p>
            <p>Preſently vppon his enterance into the Temple, he begins to purge it. Sinne muſt bee ſtrangled in the birth, before it gette ſtrength: for if it may once haue his full growth, it will bee ſure to haue the vpper hand of thee, and thou canſt not ouer-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed you before of Chriſtes careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and in this place againe you may learne his ſpeedines in reſiſting ſinne: to teach vs
<pb facs="tcp:3643:35"/> to be ſpeedy and quicke in beating downe corruptions whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Doctor Speede is the beſt Phyſition for Miſtres Vanity. Sinfulnes is ſooneſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vppon her firſt entrance: but if it ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle through continuaunce, and growe to a running fore, it muſt ſpeedily eyther bee launced, or quite cut off like a putrified member. Becauſe ſentence againſt an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therfore the harts of men are fully bent in them to doe euill. Eccles. 8. 11.</p>
            <p>The vſe of this example to our ſelues is this: When wee purpoſe to doe anie good thing, wee muſt teſtifie our carefulneſſe in dooing it preſently. If this were carefullie obſerued, much euill would ſoone be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped euen in the fountaine, before it might ſtreame foorth to the vniuerſall harme of country, citty, and common-wealth.</p>
            <p>For many times when wee minde to doe good, and doe it not preſently, our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours doe fayle betweene the purpoſe and the practize: and ſo the good to be doone, is not done at all, but it dyeth with vs, like a byrd in a mans hand, while the head is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing whether it were beſt to holde it ſtill,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:36"/> or let it goe.</p>
            <p>As this concernes all men generally: ſo in a more ſpecial manner it concernes them that are aduaunced to high place of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the Common wealth.</p>
            <p>Officers are choſen for the puniſhment of euil doers, &amp; the praiſe of them that doe well. They muſt be zealous-in Gods cauſe, by throwing out ſuch as tranſgreſſe.</p>
            <p>They muſt conſider that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted as in Gods ſtedde to puniſh male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: and therefore they muſt not ſuffer the ſword of iuſtice to ruſt in the ſcabbard of long ſufferance.</p>
            <p>And zeale it is that will ſoone aduiſe you, when and how this may be done: zeale wil tell you by the qualitie of the offence how it may be beſt corrected. For greater ſins, muſt of neceſſity haue greater puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as olde and feſtered ſores, require ſharpe and bitter medicaments.</p>
            <p>Onely be couragious, ſaith the Lorde to Ioſuah, and I will be with thee: ſo to the Magiſtrate God ſpeaketh, Onely be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and I will be with thee.</p>
            <p>Zeale beſt graceth an Officer, &amp; it is firſt named among thoſe 4. in Exod. 18. 21. Such
<pb facs="tcp:3643:36"/> as muſt be ready with Phineas, to kill ſin in the act. They muſt when occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, learne to proteſt with Nehemiah, <hi>If you doe it once more, I will lay hands vpon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This want of zeale in Officers, ſuffering ſinnes to paſſe with immunitie, is the cauſe that corruption nowe carrieth ſuch a ſway, and doth ſpread it ſelfe like a cankerworme ouer the world.</p>
            <p>What a diſcontentment &amp; mutinous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage did Corah and his rebellious confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates cauſe the Iſraelites to grow vnto, when being prepoſſeſt with a key-colde concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes, and an ouer-weening opinion, they would haue perſwaded Moſes that all was well, and the people holy enough?</p>
            <p>Surely the beſt workes we can doe, yea, our religion it ſelfe, is ſtarke dead afore vs, vntill zeale come. Religion without zeale, is like the Sunamites dead childe, vvithout breath, life, or ſoule in it.</p>
            <p>All our knowledge, our wiſedom, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues can litle auaile vs, litle can they doe, if onely zeale be abſent.</p>
            <p>They can profit vs no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſtaffe could recouer the dead chyld, till Eliſha came himſelfe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:37"/>
            <p>Let fayth come, and yet thou art vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, let patience come, and thou art yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, let temperance come, and thou art yet vnperfect, let charity and chaſtitie and all come that may come, and thou art ſtill vnperfect. Thou art but a maymed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, like Agrippa till zeale come, &amp; then as Dauid ſaid, <hi>The riuers of God are full,</hi> ſo maiſt thou ſay, The graces of God are full. Thou art as well furniſhed as Zacheus was, when Chriſt told him, <hi>This day is ſaluation come to thine houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is ſathans policie, when hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drawe vs from religion, nor from our proſeſſion, yet euen then will hee ſeeke to hinder vs in our good courſe: he will ſtand like a Lyon in the paſſages, that we be not too forward, eyther to ſtop vs in our run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by one rub of iniquitie or other, or by laying ſome pleaſant baite before vs, to tum vs aſide out of the way: as hee cooſend A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam out of Paradice.</p>

            <p>The Miniſter of Laodicia had many good qualities that graced him: but one vice marrs many good vertues, as one dead flie putrifieth the ſwee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In a worde, this pollution is vniuerſall whereſoeuer any kinde of vngodlines ſhall take place. And the ſoueraine helpe for all this is that which our Sauiour in his owne example hath heere taught vs. When &amp; ſo often as theſe corruptions ſhall breake out, wee muſt caſt them out betimes, as Chriſt did the buyers and ſellers. This ſpeedy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging muſt be effected by the word in the godly Miniſter, and by the ſword of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the ciuill Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Euery man can beſt ſound his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by ſending downe the bucket of Gods ſpirit into his hart. Euery man can beſt ſatifie himſelfe, whether he hath clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his body, by caſting out all ſin and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſo conſecrating it as a holy Temple vnto the Lord, or whether hee hath abuſed it, by giuing it ouer to all ſenſualitie vvith
<pb facs="tcp:3643:40"/> greedines, ſuffering ſin and ſathan to haue ingreſſe, and egrelle and regreſſe at theyr pleaſures, till the graue be poſſeſt of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the wormes of his fleſh, and the worlde of his goods. And ſo he returne more rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of the world, then the matter hee was firſt made of when hee firſt came into the world.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how the temple of GOD may be polluted, and ſo in time a generall rent be made from the top to the bottome, till it be quite deſtroyed and defaced as that famous Temple of Ieruſalem is now defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and lyeth in the duſt.</p>
            <p>But let vs beware how wee runne to the like ruine: howe wee deſtroy this Temple of God, not made with hands, but by the mightie power of God: for feareful is that ſaying; <hi>He that dest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <q>A houſe of prayer.</q>
            <p>The Temple is called not the houſe of crueltie, nor the houſe of maliciouſnes, nor the houſe of pride, nor the houſe of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, as theſe Merchants thought to make it, but the houſe of praier. The Iewes had Citties of refuge to ſhe vnto: but the place of refuge for Chriſtians nowe to ſlye vnto, is <hi>Templum Dei,</hi> the houſe of prayer. Here is the place where the Prieſtes &amp; the people ought to pray before the lord, euen betweene <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>estibulum et Altare,</hi> the porch and the Altar, as Ioell ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>In the 7. of Math it is ſaid, <hi>Seeke and you ſhall find.</hi> If wee will ſind Chriſt, heere is the place where we muſt ſeek him: not as they that ſought after Eliah when hee was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but as Ioſeph and Mary ſought for their ſonne, in the temple they ſought him,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:46"/> and there they found him: and there ſhall wee be ſure to finde him, if wee ſeeke after him with the like affection that they did.</p>
            <p>And hauing found him: if you wil know how you may both ſpeake with him, and ſpeed with him in your godly requeſts, this place reſolues you, <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benger, to paſſe from you to him, &amp; it will in no wiſe returne againe to you, till it hath preuailed, like the Doue that returned with the Oliue leafe in her bill. Prayer poured out with deuotion, &amp; vttered with zeale, is for power ſo forcible, and for motion ſo ſwift, that it pearceth like a Thunder-bolt clowdes &amp; skies, and hauing come to God, it departs not away, till it hath preuailed by ſtrong wreſtlings, like Iacob for a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>In the 2. chro. 6. we find Salomon praying in the temple: he deſired God that his eyes ſhould euer be open, &amp; his eares alwaies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to the prayers that ſhould be offred vp in that place: and his prayer then, is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for vs now that pray before the lord in the temple, beeing the place whereof hee hath ſpoken, he would put his name there. This houſe of prayer hath been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>requented by the godly in all ages, ſince there began

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Temple, yet there were ſolemne aſſemblies and holy meetings from the beginning.</p>
            <p>In the 4. of Gen. vpon the reſtoring and reeſtabliſhing of religion, preſently after the byrth of Sheth, wee reade that men aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together, &amp; called vpon the name of the Lord. After the flood, Noah &amp; his familie ſacrificed vnto the Lord. Gen. 8. 20. And after him, Abraham built an Altar at Bethell, and called vppon the Name of the Lord. Iacob did the like, and Moſes &amp; all ages to Chriſt. The Tabernacle made by Moſes, was in ſted of a Temple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reuerence my Sanctuary.</hi> Leuit. Peter &amp; Iohn went vp to the Temple to pray. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon went to the Temple. Anna prayd in the Temple.</p>
            <p>Here is the place where the afflicted may finde conſolation: the poore may finde plenty: the wealthy ſhal find thankfulnes: and the thankful ſhall haue more gifts: the deſperate ſhall finde comfort: the ſicke a Phiſition: the ſinner in a word, ſhall finde his Sauiour, where he may embrace him in his armes, if he will, as Symeon did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of prayer,]</hi> that is, of publique prayer, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:3643:47"/> not of priuate. If we will pray priuatly, wee haue houſes to pray in at home. Enter into thy chamber, and there poure out thy hart vnto God, and hee that heareth thee in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, ſhall reward thee openly.</p>
            <p>If thou pray when thou ſhouldeſt heare, thou prophaneſt the place, and thy prayer ſhal returne as a curſe into thy boſome. For <note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> the word of truth hath ſpoken it; <hi>Hee that turnes away his eare from hearing the law, his prayer ſhall be abhominable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not a priuat place, and therfore it wil entertaine no priuate action. If thy heart call vpon thee to preſent any priuat prayer to the Lord, follow the vſe of holy men in all ages. Iſaac went out into the fieldes to pray and meditate. Iacob beeing alone in Bethel, fell to prayer. Gen. 28. Dauid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his couch with teares which fell from him while he prayed. Daniell in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fell to prayer. Dan. 6. Peter in the 9. of the Acts went vp to the top of the houſe to pray. Chriſt went aſide into the mountaine to pray.</p>
            <p>If I pray, beeing in the Temple, and all the congregation there preſent, &amp; another preacheth, &amp; a third man ſtanding by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:48"/> heere is no order, but confuſion, and God is not the God of confuſion.</p>
            <p>Let all things in the Church be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you ſeene Chriſt our Lorde entering into the Temple in deuotion, and in zeale correcting the abuſes that hee found there. Teaching them withall, the right vſe of the Temple, and what exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of holines the place requireth, that ſo they might not come together to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Let it be conſidered what is ſayd, and the Lord giue vs vnderſtanding in all thinges, that hauing attained in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the fulneſſe of knowledge that is in Chriſt Ieſus, and beeing ſtabliſhed in euery good worke and word, our fruite may be holines, and our end euerlaſting life. Let vs pray the ſpirit of Grace to enter into the temples of our harts, and thence to purge and caſt out all corruptions whatſoeuer.</p>

            <p>TWo principall motiues or reaſons, beloued in our Lord, induced me to make choiſe of this Text. One vvas the occaſion of our meeting at this time, which is, to ſolemnize &amp; keep in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the Natiuity of our Lord &amp; Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus. The other, the great neceſſity of the doctrine in theſe wordes contained.

            <p>There ſhoulde be no matter of greater force to draw men together, than this vvee haue nowe in hand: for it is able to furniſh vs with all neceſſary knowledge, like the roule that Ezechiell tooke from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had eaten, it filled both <note place="margin">Ezch, 3,</note> belly and bowels: &amp; hee ſtraightwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prophecy.</p>
            <p>We liue not in thoſe times wherein vve may offer rich preſents vnto Chriſt, like the Wiſemen, nor can wee nowe poynt at the bodily preſence of Chriſt, as Iohn did: not can we feaſt him in our houſes, as Zacheus did, nor can we embrace him in our armes, as once Symeon did, when hee came by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration into the Temple.</p>

            <p>This time wherin we celebrate our lords natiuity, we make it a time of feaſting, and a time of merrie-making, and tyme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing: but I feare too too fewe there are, that reioyce that Chriſt was as at this tyme borne for them.</p>
            <p>If thys true reioycing were planted in vs, it would cut off much vanity and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in euill.

            <p>Heere we muſt alſo learne the obedience of Chriſt our Lord, and his humility. As it was loue in God the Father, that ſent forth Chriſt into the world: ſo it was obedience in Chriſt the Sonne of God, that brought him and preſented him vnto the world.</p>

            <p>Abraham bowed himſelfe to the Angels, to ſhew that there is no way to come neere vnto God, or to the reſemblance of Chriſt, but by humility.</p>

            <p>It followeth: <hi>In the dayes of Herod the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere is deliuered the time when Chriſt was borne. When Herod raigned in Iedea. It is woorth the noting to conſider of the tyme of Chriſtes birth.</p>
            <p>It was a time of crueltie, a time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a time of tyrannie, &amp; perſecution. The troubles that fell vppon him in his infancie, did preſage continuance of like inſuing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities through the whole courſe of his life. He found no eaſe, no peace, no place almoſt in the world, but was euer afflicted, perſecuted, betrayed, arrayned, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and at laſt crucified. </p>
            <q>In the raigne of Herod.</q>
            <p>Herod was the firſt that ſtept vppon the ſtage, and other tyrants after, ſucceeded him to act Chriſtes tragedy.</p>
            <p>The murdered innocents in that merciles
<pb facs="tcp:3643:61"/> maſſacre, can witneſſe the bloody crueltie of that time.</p>
            <p>Chriſt new borne, is compeld to flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bethleem to Egypt, like Moſes to Mydian,
<note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der babe, were driuen to flie, like as the woman in the reuel.</note> &amp; there remained till they were dead, who ſought his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the daies of Herod,]</hi> that is, in the dayes of him, whoſe power was of God: but hee abuſed his power, &amp; with the ſame ſought to deſtroy the ſonnes of God.</p>
            <p>This Herod was the ſonne of Hyrcanus, as Ioſephus noteth, in lib. 14. Antiq. ca. 18. Three circumſtances are to be noted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this cruell Herod. Firſt, hee vvas troubled when he heard of Chriſtes birth: and the rather, for that hee was termed a King. Wherein we may ſee the eare-marke of the wicked and reprobates: they be ſad when others are merry: when the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards and Wiſe men triumphed &amp; reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then was Herod and his people diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted.</p>
            <p>There coulde not come to the vvorlde greater tidings of ioy, than the newes of Chriſtes birth, ſo proclaimed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell that appeared to the Sheepheards: in teſtimony whereof, the multitudes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb facs="tcp:3643:61"/> ſouldiours praiſed God, and ſung melodiouſly vnto the Lord. Yea, and with them, the whole frame of nature ſeemed to reioyce.</p>
            <p>Yet nowe was Herod in the midſt of his dumps, not knowing which way to turne him: terrors within, and troubles without ſo affrighted him, as pangs doe a vvoman that trauaileth with child, and is plained to be deliuered. It droue him to a maze when hee heard of Chriſt, as the hand-writing droue Baithazer to a ſtackering.</p>
            <p>Herods conſcience (it ſeemes) could tell him that he had no intereſt in Chriſt, and therefore no maruell if hee were troubled. He feared alſo that he ſhould nowe loſe his kingly titles and honours, and that Chriſt would depriue him of his kingdome: and ſo ſeeking an earthly kingdome, he loſt an heauenly kingdome; and though he lyued for a ſhort time like a king, yet he dyed far vnlike a king, for hee was eaten vp of life in the midſt of his glory.</p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance. All Ieruſalem was troubled with him. Heere is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe verified, <hi>Regis ad exemplar totus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponitur orbis.</hi> The Citty was mooued to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:3643:62"/> the King mooued, the whole people frame themſelues to the paſſions of the Prince.</p>
            <p>Moſes counſell was this, <hi>Non ſequere mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem. &amp;c.</hi> Thou ſhalt not follow a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to doe euill. But in this place tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the multitude follow, and many are drawne by the example of one to doe euill. King and people &amp; all, oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is it which Dauid ſo long before prophecied of Chriſt: <hi>The kings of the earth &amp; the mightie men, haue aſſembled themſelues together: they banded themſelues against the Lord, and against his annoynted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; this feare proceeded to ſpill the blood of Saints thereby to deſtroy Chriſt. This was not <hi>Timor,</hi> but <hi>Tremor:</hi> ſuch a terrour and fearefulnes, as is wont to aſſault the reprobate.</p>
            <p>There is feare in the children of God, but it is a <hi>fihall</hi> feare, a ſonne-like feare: but this is a ſeruile feare that was in Herod; ſuch a feare as expels all good graces out of vs.</p>
            <p>Of that feare Saint Iohn ſpeaketh, when he ſaith; <hi>Feare hath painfulnes,</hi> &amp; in Herod heere it had painfulnes: for it diſquieted
<pb facs="tcp:3643:62"/> him and his people.</p>
            <p>It hath in it painfulnes, and hatefulneſſe, for ſo ſoone as this feare entred, he beganne to hate Chriſt.</p>
            <p>By this Herod, the wicked mighty men of this world are noted, which endeuour by all meanes to oppreſſe the Goſpell of Chriſt. The Tyrants of the earth could not abide that the glory of Chriſt ſhould ſtand, but they are like the 4. Angels in the Reuel. with-holding the 4. winds of the earth, that they ſhould not blow on the earth, nor on the ſea, nor vpon any greene tree.</p>
            <p>Examples of perſecuting Tyrants, are plentifull in Scripture.</p>
            <p>The tyranny of Pharao againſt Iſraell. The tyranny of Saule againſt Dauid. The tyranny of Achab perſecuting Michaeas.</p>
            <p>So the deuill ſtill hath his inſtruments to exerciſe crueltie, and to inſult ouer Gods people, as heere hee proucked Herod to perſecute Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This note among the reſt muſt not bee forgotten, concerning the time of Chriſtes birth: when moſt tiranny was vſed, &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion moſt defaced, then was Chriſt borne. And therfore in <hi>Iohn</hi> he is called <hi>Lux lucens
<pb facs="tcp:3643:63"/> in tenebris,</hi> a light ſhining in darknes.</p>
            <p>As our Sauiour was borne vnder tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: ſo haue his members euer ſince beene borne vnder tyrannie &amp; affliction: to teach vs that perſecution is euer a marke of the true Church.</p>
            <p>To drawe this doctrine to particuler ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycation. We ſee in this place the crueltie and maliciouſnes of Herod againſt Chriſt, let vs learne to hate crueltie, &amp; rather ſtriue to be meeke and gentle.</p>
            <p>God hateth nothing more than crueltie, and the blood-thirſty man neuer commeth to the graue in peace.</p>
            <p>Cruelty, rather then it ſhal ſcape without puniſhment, will be it owne executioner; like Caine, whoſe own conſcience did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him for his brothers bloode, crying within him: <hi>Whoſoeuer findes me, ſhal ſley me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this bloody tyrant Herod, be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of terrour to all that carry like bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die mindes. As Herod ſlew the poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents in Bethleem, ſo the Lord ſlew him, the bloode of thoſe innocents cryed to the Lord for reuenge, and theyr cry preuailed: for he died moſt ſhamefully. As he ſent an army of men, euen men of war to deſtroy
<pb facs="tcp:3643:63"/> all thoſe males: ſo God ſent another kinde of vvarriours to fight againſt him, euen an armie of lice. Theſe came about him in troupes, thicker than the flyes of Egypt, &amp; did eate him vp aliue, as you may reade more at large in the 12. of the Acts.</p>
            <p>And as Euſebius reporteth it: he ſeeing the iudgements of God vpon him, vttered theſe words; <hi>Qui vobis Deus videor vitam turpiter finire cogor.</hi> I that am reputed in your eyes as a God, am conſtrayned to die moſt filthily.</p>
            <p>It followeth: <hi>Wiſe men came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the East to Ieruſalem, ſaying: Where is he that is borne King of the Iewes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since neither Herod, nor his people the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, did labour to ſeek out Chriſt, loe God ſtyrreth vp others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen meere ſtrangers to come from farre, from the Eaſt to Ieruſalem to worſhip his ſonne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Prophet is not without honour ſaue in his owne Country, and amongst his owne.</hi> Chriſt beeing in Bethleem among his own, is not receiued, and therfore, as our Sauiour told the Iewes when they bragged they had A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham to theyr Father, God is able euen

            <p>In the example of theſe Wiſe men, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing ſo farre to ſeeke Chriſt, wee muſt learne, that if vvee will come to Chriſt, as vvee ought, wee muſt forſake our parents, our Countrey, and friendes.

            <p>It is neyther Angell nor Saint that can heare vs, or intreate for vs, or can grant the thing wee aske for. Chriſt alone can do it, for he alone hath borne our infirmities.</p>
            <p>Hee is the onely Phiſition that healeth vs, hee is the brazen Serpent vpon whom, vvho-ſoeuer looketh, recouereth. He is the Samaritane that powreth wine and oyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our woundes.</p>

            <p>But VViſe men they vvere, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie vviſe it ſeemes they vvere, for they vvere inflamed vvith a feruent deſire to ſee Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Some are of opinion that they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, ſuch as had skill in diuining, and interpreting difficult matters, and in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling thinges to come.

            <pb facs="tcp:3643:65"/>
            <p>Such knowledge was extraordinary: &amp; it is forbidden and accurſed in many places of Scripture. <hi>Let none bee founde among you that hath a ſpirit of diuination: or that is a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And ſuch it may be were theſe Wiſe men before they knewe Chriſt: but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wiſedome went from them, vvhen the true knowledge of Chriſt was implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Magi</hi> were Wiſe-men and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, they firſt came to ſee Chriſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called the firſt fruites of the Gentiles: they had neither the law nor the Prophets read vnto them, yet they firſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde out Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Signifying, that it is God onely who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euery Chriſtian mans hart, hee can ſoone turne Dauid from adultery, Adam to confeſſe his ſinne: Paule of a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to become a profeſſor. He can make of ſtones, ſonnes to Abraham, and of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſound Chriſtians. As heere hee cauſed theſe Wiſe men to come from farre, euen from the Eaſt to Ieruſalem to vvorſhippe
<pb facs="tcp:3643:65"/> Chriſt: So is there no reſpect of perſons with God, but in all places, who ſo feareth him, and worketh righteouſnes, ſhalbe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. </p>
            <q>From the East to Ieruſalem.</q>
            <p>As Chriſt our Lorde came from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of his Father to be incarnate, and to dwell among vs: ſo theſe Wiſe men came from theyr country from the Eaſt, to finde out Chriſt their Redeemer.</p>
            <p>This ſheweth theyr great deſire.

            <p>By grace they ſought him, and by fayth they founde him, whom they woulde not loſe againe for the gayning of the world.</p>
            <p>But leaue wee theſe Wiſe men thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling, &amp; returne we to our ſelues awhile, and I doubt not before wee haue done, by the guide of that ſtarre in this ſtory menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, to place the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Inne at Bethleem, together with that princely babe, though

            <p>VVhere-vnto againe may I liken thys loue? It is like to Iacobs ladder, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from the earth to the heauens: on the <note place="margin">Gene, 28.</note> which were Angels deſcending and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; God himſelfe ſlanding aboue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the top of it.</p>

            <p>Iacobs ladder reached vp to heauen, and this muſt be our ladder, if we will learn like the Angels to aſcend vp where God is.</p>
            <p>A chaine conſiſts of many linkes, and all are faſtned in ſo ſure one in another, that they cannot be ſundred or deuided, and he that drawes but the one linke, drawes vnto him all the whole chaine. Thys chavne is loue, and we muſt of neceſſity be poſſeſt of

            <p>Nay, there is ſuch a mutuall relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene GOD and vs, if thys loue bee in vs whereof wee ſpeake, that wee can in no ſort ſeparate the one from the other, no not in <hi>intellectu,</hi> not ſo much as in conceit, as the Schoole-men terme it.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Saint Iohn proouing the ſame, where he ſayth, <hi>GOD is loue, and hee that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, &amp; God in him. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thys loue is two-ſold, conſiſting of two parts: The loue of God towards vs, and our loue to one another.</p>
            <p>VVee ought firſt to conſider of Gods loue, and then to deſcend to our ſelues, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a patterne firſt of his loue towards vs, and out of it to frame a like loue in our ſelues one to another.</p>
            <p>God goeth before vs in the example of thys loue and we muſt follow after as neere as wee can, in practizing the like loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="tcp:3643:76"/> our ſelues. </p>
            <q>Heerein is loue.</q>
            <p>The principall propoſition handled by the Apoſtle in thys place, is the generall doctrine of Chriſt, who was ſent foorth from the boſome of his Father vnto the vvorld, to reconcile vs by the vertue of his death: which doctrine is grounded vppon theſe arguments, for ſtrength like a brazen vvall, againſt which, ſathan and the power of hell cannot preuaile.</p>
            <p>The firſt argument is drawne from the mercie or loue of God: in theſe vvordes: <hi>Heerein is loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond from his will, beeing a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall effect of his loue, in theſe words: <hi>And ſent his ſonne. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many properties and attributes are in GOD, vvhich it behooueth vs eſpecially to take notice of.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hee is omnipotent, prooued by his Creation. Wiſe, by his daily gubernation. Iuſt in his promiſes. Mercifull, for hee ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſinners. Louing to all, for hee calleth all, and is carefull for all.</p>
            <p>But ſpecially for the elect: who do heare when he calleth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:77"/>
            <p>His lone is heere iuſtified: for that hee ſent his ſonne to the world, that ſo many as beleeued, might haue life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>The fountaine of all graces is loue, which drewe from him a greater worke then the Creation of the world: euen the vvork of our Redemption, a matter of ſo great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, that it cauſed all the Prophets, from Adam the ſonne of God, to Iohn Baptiſt the ſonne of Zacharie, in all times and ages to ſpeake and write of this ſuperabundant grace and rich good will long before the foundations of the world determined, but in the fulneſſe of time reuealed vnto vs by the comming of his Sonne, by whom wee <note place="margin">

            <p>So heerein is loue: that is, a loue vvith a witnes. For God ſo loued vs, that he ſpared not his onely Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death.</p>

            <p>The ſicke is cured, but he hath forgotten the Phyſition that cured him. The diſeaſed is deliuered, and the mortall wounde is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but the Patient now become a whole
<pb facs="tcp:3643:78"/> man, remembers neyther his ſore, nor yet the Phyſition. </p>
            <q>Heerein is loue, not that we loued God.</q>
            <p>Saint Iohn in ſpeaking of this loue, doth not preſently acquaint vs with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie of this loue; but hee firſt ſuſpendeth the matter, the rather to drawe from vs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and carefulnes.</p>
            <p>Before I proceede to tell you what thys loue is, I will firſt tell you what it is not.</p>
            <p>A thing that is ſought for being preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, is no longer thought on, and ſo if the Apoſtle ſhould vppon the ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer to vs this ſo great a miſtery of Gods loue, it would be but lightly regarded.</p>
            <p>Therefore hee offers it, and yet drawes it backe againe, and then preſents it againe: ſtil offering, and yet with-holding, to make vs the rather long after it with a more eager and feruent affection.</p>
            <p>Like children in this reſpect, vvho the more they be denyed of that they woulde haue, the more they cry, &amp; do neuer leaue crying till it be giuen them. </p>
            <q>Not that we loued God.</q>
            <p>The loue I meane, ſayth Saint Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not the loue that you meane. It is not
<pb facs="tcp:3643:79"/> vaine loue, nor ſelfe-loue, nor carnall loue, nor the loue of the worlde, nor the loue of honours, nor the loue of pleaſures, nor the loue of riches, it is none of all theſe, for this is our loue: but I am to tell you of Gods loue.</p>
            <p>It was not loue in vs, but in God was this loue that cauſed Chriſt to come vnto the world Nay there was in vs no loue at all, the contrary was in vs, euen hatred and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: &amp; therfore it is ſayd, <hi>cum hostes eſſemus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore well might the Apoſtle make this concluſion againſt vs, <hi>not that we loued God.</hi> And wee our ſelues doe iuſtifie the truth therof in our ſelues, for we know that we loue our luſts, and our vanities, and the world, more then God.</p>
            <p>Adams corruption hath tranſ-fuſed it ſelfe into Adams children, euen all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie. God had giuen him all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the earth, and placed him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, this worlds heauen, heere God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited plentifull teſtimony of his loue, but Adam could ſhewe forth no loue to God for this: ſo prooued by his wilful diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The taſte of one Apple made hym forget both himſelfe and God his Maker.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:79"/> And haue not our pleaſures the ſame ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie ouer vs.</p>
            <p>Iudas ſolde his Maiſter for thirtie pence, he loued his mony better then his Maiſter, and many Mammonites now, whoſe cares are vppon theyr coffers, and whoſe mindes are vppon the bagge as Iudas was, if they would not be corrupted with mony to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Chriſt, yet they could be contented to betray the members of Chriſt, theyr bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and neighbours, for fewer ſhekels of filuer then Delilah tooke from the Princes of the Philiſtims.</p>
            <p>No man would willingly be leprous, yet many worldlings that are carried away with the loue of riches, could be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to buy a leprofie with leſſe then two bags of ſiluer,

Many Edomites liue now, that can be content to ſell a better patrimonie then he did, euen their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inhearitance which they ſhould haue in Chriſt, and all for the tranſitory pleaſures of this life.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, we ſhould loue God onelie &amp; principally, before all things. We ſhould loue God more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our parents, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, our friends, our ſelues. &amp;c.</p>

We are all like Demas loth to part with the world, &amp; like the young rich man in the goſpel, who was vnwilling to leaue his poſſeſſions: he loued his vvealth better than Chriſt. And therefore, vvhen Chriſt bad him folow him, he choſe rather to folow the world. And al the peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in the earth, are not able to ſette theſe
<pb facs="tcp:3643:80"/> two at one, the loue of God, &amp; the loue of the world. For Chriſt hath ſpoken it, <hi>If you loue the world, the loue of God cannot be in you.</hi> You ſee the truth then of this concluſion, <hi>not that we loued God, but that God loued vs: and ſent his Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere the Apoſtle ſheweth the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie of the loue, which all this while hee ſuſpended. <hi>Heerein is that loue manifested, in ſending his ſonne. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was no good thing in vs at all, no mirit or deſert that might moue GOD to giue vs his Sonne. It was his loue onely, and the good pleaſure of his wil, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh to the Epheſians, in the firſt chapter.</p>
            <p>Our aduerſaries ought to bluſh, if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian modeſtie did reſt vpon them, vvhen they read this text in Iohns Epiſtle, &amp; that other in his goſpel: ſince they denie that truth which is is both places &amp; elſwhere ſo ſtrongly maintained.</p>
            <p>They would perſwade men by their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of merit, that this loue of God is but a matter of courſe: as if God were bounde to loue vs, and that we can deſerue at gods hands to be ſo loued.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:81"/>
            <p>Yea, they ſay we may doe good works of Supererogation, more then God requireth. Wee neede not farre fet Scriptures to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſuch. One Text of many ſhal ſuffiſe, this now in handling. <hi>God loued vs first,</hi> and not we him.</p>
            <p>Nay, he loued vs when we hated him, and fell from him by wilful tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as Adam had ſinned, GOD in this his loue ſalued him with the promiſe of Chriſt, the ſeede of the vvoman breaking the Serpents head.</p>
            <p>This loue of God was vniuerſall, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all men, of all ſorts, Iewes and Gentiles, circumciſed and vncircumciſed, bond and free, beleeuers and vnbeleeuers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In thy ſeede ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> All might haue taken hold of this bleſſing, as freely as Adam might ſtretch his hand to all the trees of the garden, ſaue the tree of knowledge. God would haue all men to bee ſaued, and therefore Chriſt was offred to all: but in that all bee not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the fault is theyrs that will not pertake of this bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The death of Chriſt was ſufficient for al, but it was not effectuall for all: it was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
<pb facs="tcp:3643:81"/> onely for the beleeuers.</p>
            <p>And therfore ſaith this ſame Iohn in the 3. Chap. of his Goſpel: That, <hi>ſo many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued on him, ſhould not perriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All were bidden to the marriage of the Kings Sonne, yet all did not come: nay, they who were firſt bidden came not at all. So the fault was theirs, that refuſed, being ſo ſolemnly inuited.</p>
            <p>In like manner, all are not ſaued that are called to partake of this loue of God, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally made knowne to the whole world in Chriſt, who would haue all men to be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Onely the beleeuers haue this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſent his ſonne to be a reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Infinite are the teſtimonies of Gods loue towards vs, as Paule ſaid, <hi>O how vnſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are thy iudgements (O Lord) and thy waies past finding out:</hi> So may wee ſay; ô howe deepe is thy loue (ô Lord) towards vs, how vnſearchable &amp; paſt finding out? no buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of mans vnderſtanding is able to ſound the bottome of this bottomleſſe fountaine.</p>

               <hi>Heerein is loue, not that wee loued God, but that God loued vs, and ſent his Sonne to be a reconciliation for our ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It followeth.] <hi>Beloued, if God ſo loued vs, we ought alſo to loue one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not capable of this loue of God, except we alſo loue one another.</p>
            <p>Gods loue going firſt, ſhould beget and forme in vs a like loue one towardes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Heere then wee are to learne a leſſon of charity.</p>
            <p>It is ſayd, that loue couereth a multitude of ſinnes. If wee will haue many ſinnes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, we muſt labour for this charity.</p>
            <p>Wee ought to loue euen our enemies, as God loued vs being his enemies: but much rather our brethren and neighbours.</p>
            <p>This is not a common loue, but a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue that is heere meant, ſuch a loue as Peter commended to the Church, in his 1. Epiſtle. 1. 22. <hi>Loue one another with a pure hart, feruently.</hi> Where we may obſerue the properties of true loue, which is, It muſt be brotherly, pure, and feruent.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:85"/>
            <p>Brotherly: not after a common affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for brotherhood is the bond that knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth together Chriſtians among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues euen as brothers, without any reſpect, or difference: for we haue all but one Chriſt, one baptiſme, and one fayth; ſo we ſhould haue all one loue.</p>
            <p>Pure it muſt be: without faining, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out glozing, without hipocriſie.</p>
            <p>For many call their neighbours, brethren, and friends: and yet will not ſtick priuily and ſecretly to vndermine them.</p>
            <p>It muſt be feruent: there is heate in true loue, as there is fire in iealouſie.</p>
            <p>VVhere this heate is, it will make thee tender thy friend ſo deerely, as that thou wilt not ſtick to lay downe thy life for him, as Chriſt laide downe his life for the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>If you will knowne the excellencie of this loue, peruſe at your leaſure the 13. of the firſt to the Corinthians, there you may ſee the wonderfull effects of it. No vertue in the worlde brancheth it ſelfe into ſo many ſtrange operations of godlines: it will be a ſpectacle worth the looking on, to behold vpon one ſtalke ſo many fruites growing
<pb facs="tcp:3643:86"/> of infinite varieties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ſuffereth long, it is bountifull: it enuieth not, it boastes not it ſelfe, it is not puffed vp, it diſdayneth not: it is not prouoked to anger, it reioyeeth not in iniquitie: it ſuffereth all thinges, it beleeueth all thinges, it neuer falls away. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I end with this one note: if you will be reſolued, that this loue is in you, wherof we ſpeake, you ſhal principally know it by this one fruite among many.</p>
            <p>You will ſo loue one another, that you wil wholely imploy your endeuours to doe good one to another, and not euill all the dayes of our lyues.</p>
            <p>You will forget and forgiue all iniuries, and treſpaſſes committed, for his ſake, who forgiueth you your great treſpaſſes, your ſinnes: a greater debt then vvas forgiuen to the mercileſſe debter.</p>
            <p>We cannot come neerer to God, than in the reſemblance of this loue. S. Iohn proues it, <hi>If thou loue not thy brother whom thou haſt ſeene, how ſhouldst thou loue God whom thou hast not ſeene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou ſinneſt ten thouſand times more againſt God, than thy neighbour can treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:3643:86"/> againſt thee, yet he forgiues thee all: and canſt not thou forgiue thy brother?</p>
            <p>Some can ſoone ſhift of the matter, by aunſwering it thus. I will forgiue him, but Ile neuer forget him.</p>
            <p>He ſhall come to my <hi>pater noster,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to my Creede.</p>
            <p>God vvill reaunſwere ſuch in the ſame meaſure. Thou ſhalt come to my preſence, where thou ſhalt ſee me and my holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all the holy company of heauen in that honorable conſiſtory, when quick and <note place="margin">Omnis caro.</note> dead ſhall be iudged: but thou ſhalt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from that holy ſociety: Thou ſhalt not reſt vpon my holy mountaine.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue ſeene God louing vs, and manifeſting the ſame, his loue, in ſending vs his ſonne to reconcile vs.</p>
            <p>You haue ſeene, how tender hee is ouer vs, &amp; how gracious in louing vs; more then that, howe carefull to manifeſt his loue, in ſending vs his onely ſonne to reconcile vs: and laſtly, what he requireth of vs in liew of this his carefulnes: which is, that he louing vs, we ſhould alſo loue one another.</p>
            <p>God is the firſt that inuiteth, and the laſt that forſaketh, neuer leauing, but firſt left,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:87"/> and euer offering till he be refuſed.</p>
            <p>Hee ſtill ſpreadeth his armes, like as the Cherubins doe their wings.</p>
            <p>O let vs yeelde to his embracings, leaſt when wee would, he will not: and ſo wee ſeeke the bleſſing with Eſau, too late, and cannot preuaile though we ſhedde many teares.</p>
            <p>And ſo I end this Loue-ſong as I began, to the end, that if you be ſo dull of hearing, as that you haue forgotten the ſum of all that hath beene deliuered; yet at leaſt you may remember the burthen of the ſong. <hi>Heerein is loue, not that we loued God, but that God loued vs, and ſent his Sonne to be a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for our ſinnes. Beloued, if God ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs, we ought alſo to loue one another.</hi>

            <p>Dauid being the yongeſt ſonne of Iſhay, and of ſmalleſt reckoning, is taken from

            <p>So God alone numbreth, wayeth, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth. Hee meaſureth ſeaſons, times, and yeares: hee ſetteth vp Kings, and putteth downe Kings at his pleaſure: as wee reade in the 2. of Dan. 21.</p>
            <p>The very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of which kindnes and exceeding fauour of the Lord, cauſed Dauid to pen this Pſalme, to teſtifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his thankfulnes. And this is briefely the ſubſtance of this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>And yet is this but a litterall conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: you muſt knowe, that another miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matter, and of greater import, is heere deliuered.</p>
            <p>In the perſon of Dauid, Chriſt our Lord is moſt liuely ſet forth. Who being the king of glory, the very ſonne of God, heire and Lord of all things, was notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of the Iewes, among whom hee was borne; he came among his owne, and his owne receaued him not.</p>
            <p>But maugre the malice of the deuill, and his inſtruments: fleſh and blood could not preuaile. Herod, and all the wayting for
<pb facs="tcp:3643:88"/> of the people of the Iewes, could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow Chriſt, and his Kingdome: Nay, they rather ouerthrow themſelues.

            <p>What was that lampe &amp; light but Chriſt, all the law and the Prophets, did preſignify to the world that Chriſt ſhould come, euen to the time that the Angell appeared to the Shepheards, and bad them goe ſee him, whom all the world deſired to behold. So that we may preach to our ſelues, as Chriſt did to the Iewes. In our eares this day are all theſe Scriptures fulfilled.</p>
            <q>This is the day.</q>
            <p>This proclamation is very ſutable to that in the ſecond of Luke, <hi>Beholde, I bring you ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It was indeed tydings of the greateſt ioy that might come into the world: for then was the world redeemed from her olde ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Then began the true ſonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes to appeare, who alone was able to expell all the clowdy miſts of ignorance.</p>
            <p>What greater ioy can be then for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to heare of liberty, the ſicke of his health, the ſinner of his ſaluation.</p>
            <p>In the comming of Chriſt, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that God ſent his Angel, he did not

               </gap>age, which ſhewes the dignity thereof. This Angell was accompanied with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ſouldiours, who ſo ſoone as theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings were publiſhed, began to ſing, <hi>Glory to God on high. Peace on earth. Good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three notable wonders wrought in one day. The firſt part of this heauenly ſong noteth, that the benefite of Chriſtes Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was not in earth onely, but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen alſo, and therefore, as there was peace on earth, ſo there was glory in heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Angels.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Peace on earth:</hi> This ſheweth that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e came as a Medratour to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and vs.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Good will towards men:</hi> To ſhew that as hee was <hi>Fons Charitatis,</hi> the fountaine of charitie, ſo he would worke loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie among men.</p>
            <p>What day coulde bring foorth greater matters, and therefore wee haue re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The day of our Creation, is in no ſort to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to this day of our Redemption. Gods mercy appeared in making vs, but his
<pb facs="tcp:3643:91"/> greater mercy in ſauing vs.</p>
            <p>Before thys day wee were in a ſtate moſt miſerable, vnder the curſe wherein Adam left vs, vnder wretchednes, vnder ſinne, the curſe of the lawe, and dominion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. But nowe that Chriſt hath appeared, hell is conquered, ſathan confounded, ſin put to flight, and heauen ſet open to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</p>
            <p>So is it verified: <hi>Heauines may indure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning:</hi> our comming in hath been with teares, but our returne to Sion, is with euerlaſting ioy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our heads.</p>
            <p>The firſt Adam brought into the worlde darknes, fearefulnes and ſorrowe, but the laſt Adam brought comfort, light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fulnes.</p>
            <p>All is changed in our ſeconde Adam, mortalitie to immortalitie, mourning to mirth, miſery to felicitie, ſadnes to ſolace: now is the ſinner iuſtified, the law diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the dead reuiued, and the deuill van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, according to his mighty power who hath ſubdued all things vnto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The Iubilee yeere to the Iſraelites vvas not halfe ſo welcome, as this day ought to
<pb facs="tcp:3643:91"/> be to vs: when that yeere came, it brought with it freedome and releaſing of debts: &amp; thys day and time, this acceptable yeere of Chriſt, hath brought vnto vs a greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, euen our ſoules freedome, &amp; a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter releaſing of debts, our ſinnes: for vvee owe vnto God more than the cruel debter, not ten thouſand talents, but ten thouſand times tenne thouſand talents.</p>
            <p>Neyther was the day of theyr deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Pharao halfe ſo acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as this day of our deliuerance is to vs. For wee are ſet free from our ſpyrituall Pharao the deuill.</p>
            <p>As Moſes ſayd to the Iſraelites, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this day:</hi> ſo I ſay, Remember this day: for it is the day of our deliuerance: the day of our redemption: the acceptable day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>This is a day wherein light firſt appeared to the Gentiles, euen to vs that were aliants from God, yet to vs hath the light appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, according to Symeons ſaying: <hi>A light to lighten the gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We that once were not a people, are now become a people: wee are made through Chriſt to bee the ſonnes of the liuing God.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:92"/> For to the Iſraelites pertained the adoption and the glory, and the couenaunt, &amp; giuing of the law, and the ſeruice of God, and the promiſes, of whom are the Fathers, and of whom concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came. Rom. 9. 4.</p>
            <p>A whole Sea of matter is heere laid open to mee, if I woulde at large diſcourſe of the ineſtimable good deriued vnto vs by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes birth: but the time will not permit: &amp; this little that hath beene ſpoken may carry you to the conſideration of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>As a certaine Geometrician, finding Hercules foote vppon Olympus, by that one foote drewe the proportion of the whole body: ſo by this little, beeing but as it were a foote, in reſpect of the body of the matter included, you may conceiue vvhat might further be amplified in this poynt: the abſolute fulneſſe whereof, wee cannot poſſibly be able to comprehend.</p>
            <p>Onely let vs conſider that as at this tyme God ſent his ſonne to be our Sauiour. Hee hath giuen vs him, and all things with him, ſo that we may nowe ſay with the Apoſtle Saint Paule, <hi>All is ours, the world and the Creatures, thinges preſent and things to come,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:92"/> all is ours, and wee are Christes, and Christ is GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>It followeth: <hi>Let vs reioyce.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Abraham ſeeing Chriſtes daies a farre of reioyced: and yet hee was before Chriſt thrice foure-teene generations: How may wee reioyce, that liue to thoſe daies alreadie determined?</p>
            <p>Neyther Abraham, nor the Patriarchs, nor all the Prophets coulde ſay as we can: They coulde ſay no more but Chriſt ſhall come, vvee can ſay he is come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes that ſee the thinges that you ſee, and the eares that heare the thinges that you heare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhere it appeareth, vvee are rather bleſſed than all that vvere before Chriſt. <hi>The Kinges of the earth haue deſired to ſee that which you ſee. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that vvere before Chriſt, ſawe but a glymſe of that lyght, the fulneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee nowe behold, like the Sunne in his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Wee haue ſeene the righteouſnes of Sion breake out like the light, and the ſaluation thereof as a burning lampe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:93"/>
            <p>Thus haue we a greater priuiledge than the Keyſars and mighty Monarchs might be ſuffered to enioy. For vs were theſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things reſerued, euen we that now lyue in the time of the glorious Kingdome of Chriſt, haue obtayned this ſo rich preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: all to ſhew foorth the greatnes of our felicitie.</p>
            <p>Great cauſe haue we then to reioyce. As the babe ſprang in Elizabeths wombe: ſo ſhoulde our harts ſpring within our bodies for ioy of the preſence of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If Annah reioyced for that GOD gaue her a ſonne, and ſo tooke away the rebuke of her barrennes, much more cauſe haue wee to reioyce, that God hath giuen vs his ſonne to be borne for vs, whereby our bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes of fayth is taken away, and vvee are made fruitefull in the workes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>If Iephtah his daughter went out vvith Tymbrels to welcome home her Father, how may we prepare to welcome a greater then Iephtah, nay a greater then Salomon. How ſhould we prepare our minſlrelſie to welcome home thys victorious Lyon of the Trybe of Iuda, ſince by him we do returne
<pb facs="tcp:3643:93"/> in victorie? and may tryumph as Iephtha did, not ouer a ſew faint-harted Gybeonits, but ouer many millions of ſpirituall aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; Sin, death and hell, this worlde, and the luſts thereof.</p>
            <p>Wee haue then cauſe to reioyce and to prepare our muſicall inſtruments. VVee ſhould ſay with Dauid: <hi>Awake vp Lute and Harpe, awake vp my glory, I my ſelfe will awake right early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Dauid daunced before the Ark, which was but a teſtimony &amp; a ſigne of gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, how would Dauid haue daunced &amp; skypt, and trypt it, if he had liued to ſee his Lord walking vppon the earth, as his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did?</p>
            <p>What ſhould I more ſay: ſurely this is all I can ſay: if this loue of Chriſt, &amp; this true reioycing were planted in you, you would carry leſſe loue to the world then you do.</p>
            <p>Neyther the loue of riches, nor the loue of honour, nor the loue of long life, no wealth, no friendes, no treaſure, ſhoulde weare it: the gayning of tenne thouſande worlds ſhould not be able to draw vs from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Symeon was wearie of the world vvhen
<pb facs="tcp:3643:94"/> once hee had founde Chriſt: <hi>Nowe let mee die,</hi> ſaith he: As if he ſhould ſay, Now haue I had the fruition of the greateſt bleſſing, a greater treaſure then this, the worlde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford me: <hi>For mine eyes haue ſeene my ſaluation.</hi> And ſo haue our eyes ſeene the ſame ſaluation: wee ſhould therefore loue the world no more than Simeon did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I count all things but loſſe,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi>

            <q>Let vs reioyce.</q>
            <p>This reioycing is not a matter ſo ſoone practized as many conceiue it to be.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:94"/>
            <p>Euerie man will be ready to ſay wee doe reioyce, and wee are right glad of thys day of the Lorde.

            <p>And to this purpoſe wee deck our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and our ſtreetes, &amp; our Temples vvith boughes, like them that ſtrewed branches in the way where Chriſt ſhould come, and crying <hi>Hoſanna</hi> before him as hee rid to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>

            <p>Hence we may learne the manner of true reioycing. Wee ſhould be euer meditating vpon the Lords mercies: and wee ſhoulde publiſh them to our chyldren.

            <p>O that this one ſentence of terrour were ingrauen in the tables of our hearts, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in lead, or in ſtone, for euer.</p>
            <p>This one ſentence of the ſeuerity of gods iuſtice againſt ſuch, would make vs beware to tranſgreſſe: and how to carry our ſelues in a greater meaſure of ſobrietie.</p>
            <p>Surely great, and beioynd meaſure intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
<pb facs="tcp:3643:97"/> is the vanitie of ſinfull men in thys behalfe: for we diſhonour God in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies where we ſhould glorifie him. GOD hath made vs Chriſtian men, but we ſhewe our ſelues no men, but beaſts among men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that loueth father or mother more then me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is not worthy of me.</hi> We do worſe, we loue our follies, our vanities, and our paſtimes more then God.</p>
            <p>Some are giuen to one vanitie, ſome to another: as all ſinnes are not found in one, and yet in one are many founde, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e without ſome, and all are in vs, and among vs all.</p>
            <p>Our true reioycing were rather this, to beſtow the time in meditation, ſtil to praiſe God for this rich treaſure, to penne godlie ſongs and pſalmes of thankfulnes like Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid: to be deuiſing with Micah what wee ſhould giue vnto the Lord, for that which he hath giuen vs.</p>
            <p>Wee hang our houſes with Holies and greene boughes: but we our ſelues ſhould rather be holy boughes, euen trees of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, as we are called by Eſay. 61.</p>
            <p>If wee will needes feaſt, let vs yet beware of the abuſes in feaſting. Iob can beſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
<pb facs="tcp:3643:97"/> vs heerein. We reade in the 1. chapter of his booke, That when his ſonnes and daughters had made an end of banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in theyr houſes, euery one his day, hee like a carefull Father ſent for them, and ſanctified them, and ſacrificed for them. And this did Iob euery day: for he feared his ſonnes had blaſphemed God in theyr harts.</p>
            <p>Iob doubted that his children had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many ſlips, and that they carried not themſelues in ſuch a Chriſtian-like ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as was required in thoſe holy feaſts, and therefore hee did both ſend for them, and ſacrificed for them.</p>
            <p>Parents ouer their children, and maiſters ouer their houſholds, ſhould be armed with like godly iealouſie. For if this religious care were had both of our ſelues and ours, fewer offences would be committed; or at leaſt beeing committed, they would bee ſoone ſalued by prayer and ſanctiſication, as Iob did.</p>
            <p>For this example is pend and regiſtred for our good, and for our imitation, that in all our feaſtings, and meetings, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-makings, wee ſhould remember our
<pb facs="tcp:3643:98"/> ſelues, &amp; pray that God would pardon our corruptions and prophane carriage of our ſelues, in time of our feaſting.</p>
            <p>For it is an hard and difficult matter, at ſuch times to keepe our ſelues ſo cleare, but ſome corruption or other will cling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
            <p>Sinnes then are ſooneſt ſwallowed, lyke the dainty morſells that paſſe downe our throates: and ſo ſinne goes downe as faſt, and is deuoured with pleaſure, like the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that Eue taſted. The pleaſantnes of it to the eye, and the toothſomnes of it to the mouth, pricked forward her deſire, and ſo in eating ſhee fell, and ſo in eating vvee fall.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is ſayde, <hi>Woe to the full,</hi> for the full are apt to ſorget God.</p>
            <p>The deuill neuer fell to tempting, till the houre of eating came. And when hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger called for meate, hee alſo called for his temptations, and preſented before them the moſt delicious meate, ſuch as hee well knewe was fitting to theyr ſwnet-mouthd humours.</p>
            <p>It behooueth vs therefore eſpeciallie, to beware howe wee feaſt, not for that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb facs="tcp:3643:98"/> in it ſelfe is euill: nay, it is a thing commended and commaunded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the feaſtes of Tabernacles, and the feaſtes of Sabaoths, and Iubilees, and new moones, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt wrought his firſt miracle at a feaſt.</p>
            <p>The abuſe it is that wee ſpeake of, which often is committed in our feaſtinges. For in our pleaſures the deuill hath hidde hys ſnares: and therfore a godly man giues this prouiſo or caueat.</p>
            <p>Handle your pleaſures (ſayeth hee) as you handle Bees, that is, firſt take out the ſting, and after, you may play with them without harme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be that my Sonnes haue ſinned, and blaſphemed God in their harts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So let vs ſay of our ſelues, as Iob ſpake of his Sonnes: It may be, in this tyme of our banquetting, we haue ſinned and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.</p>
            <p>It may be, our good cheere, and delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fare, and our carde-playing, and our dauncing, and our reuelling, and our other vanities, haue made vs forgette GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:99"/> and our ſelues, and forget Chriſt, who is the feaſt-maker, the cauſe and Author of our meeting at this time.</p>
            <p>Now then that I haue ſhewed you the difference betweene the true reioycing and the falſe: aduiſe your ſelues which you will follow.</p>
            <p>As Ioſuah ſaid at his farewell, when hee was to be gathered to his people, &amp; to goe the way of all the worlde. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>chooſe you, whether you will ſerue the Gods of the heathen, or ſerue the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I ſay, whether you will hence-forth ſerue your luſtes, or ſerue God. <hi>If God be God, ſerue him: If Baal be God, ſerue him.</hi> Eyther ſticke to vanity, or ſticke to God. God hath not redeemed you to ſinne any more; but that you ſhould ſubdue, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly kill the whole body of ſinne: for it is ſaid, <hi>Be ye holy, as I am holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But know, that if you runne on in your vanities, you runne from God, who hath created you, and from Chriſt who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed you; and from the ſpirit of God, by whom you are ſealed.</p>
            <p>If wee ſinne wilfully nowe after we haue receaued the knowledge of the truth, there
<pb facs="tcp:3643:99"/> remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinne: but a fearefull looking for of iudgement, and <note place="margin">Heb. 10, 26,</note> violent fire, which ſhall deuoure the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</p>
            <p>Full of dreadfulnes is that, in the 6. of the ſame Author to the Heb. It is impoſſible that they which were once lightned, and haue taſted of the heauenly gift, and were made pertakers of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; haue taſted of the good worde of God, and the powers of the world to come: if they fall <note place="margin">Heb. 6, 4.</note> away, ſhould be renued againe by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſeeing they crucifie the ſonne of god, and make a mock of him.</p>
            <p>But beloued, wee haue perſwaded our ſelues better things of you, and things that accompanie ſaluation, though wee thus ſpeake.</p>
            <p>God forbid that I ſhould thinke, that all the good ſeede of the worde, ſo plentifully ſowed in your harts now, the ſpace of forty yeares, ſhould fall to the ground in vaine.</p>
            <p>Paul hath not ſo planted you: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The thornes choake not all; nor doe the birds deuoure vp all; nor is all fallen vpon ſtony ground to hinder the growth of the word.</p>

            <p>GOD hath made vs principally, and before all thinges, to glorifie him, and ſerue him in holines all the daies of our ſinfull pylgrimage; he hath alſo for a ſecondarie purpoſe created vs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be helpfull and ſeruiceable one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>

               </gap>ghbours, whereby wee may incurre their hatred and diſpleaſure. God dooth looke into our carriage &amp; behauior among our ſelues, that we offend not one another: that ſo being created after the ſimilitude of God, in holines, wee might alſo bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
<pb facs="tcp:3643:101"/> in holding on our courſe in the ſame holines, by performing all Chriſtian duties both towards God and man.</p>
            <p>The vvhole duty of a Chriſtian man, conſiſts but in two points: viz. in holines towards God, and in righteouſnes towards man: aunſvverable to that ſhort diuiſion made by our Sauiour. Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy hart, &amp;c. And thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The one dooth neceſſarily imply the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they cannot be ſeperated: for S. Iohn prooues it. <hi>If thou loue not thy brother whom thou hast ſeene, howe canst thou loue God whom thou hast not ſeene?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the latter onely I am to ſpeake in this place: and of that, but in a particularity neither, as my Text doth leade me.</p>
            <p>This portion of Scripture nowe to bee handled is one of the branches of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, in the ſecond table, inforcing righteouſnes towards man.</p>
            <p>It is one of the edges of that more than one edged ſword, to cut in ſunder the very hart-ſtrings of falſe witnes-bearing. For a falſe tale is a falſe teſtimony: and the ſecret accuſing of our neighbours by bad reports,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:101"/> whereby their name and fame may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, is a <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind of falſe witnes bearing: and it is ſuch a treſpaſſe, as doth quite ouerthrow the peaceable ſtate of all Chriſtian ſocieties. </p>
            <q>Thou ſhalt not walke about with tales among my people.</q>
            <p>God in this place, vſeth two principall arguments, to inforce this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. The one taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perſon of our ſelues, in the word <hi>thou:</hi> and the other from the perſon of God, in the word <hi>ſhalt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou,</hi> being as thou art, my creature, the workmanſhip of my hands, whom I haue formed and faſhioned out of the clay, and ſo by breathing into thee breath of life, did make thee a lyuing ſoule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou,</hi> who art but vile earth, very corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rottennes: <hi>Thou ſhalt not. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The carefull remembrance of our ſelues in a dutifull remorce, is a matter of ſuch force, that it is able to batter, or at leaſt, to mollifie the moſt obdurate heart of anie Chriſtian, and to ſtirre him vp to a ſincere obedience toward God his Creatour.</p>
            <p>Nature it ſelfe hath ſtampt a reuerent impreſſion, euen in the vnreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

            </p>
            <p>Though it were practiſed by a prophane man, yet was it a practiſe of Chriſtianity, that which we read of Phillip King of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon: Hee cauſed this leſſon of mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bee euery morning ſounded at his dore: <hi>Memento Philippe te eſſe hominem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This leſſon did hee learne, euen in the morning, in the beginning of the day, leaſt his kingly tytles, and honours, and magnificence, might make him forget him ſelfe, as Coruinus forgot his name.</p>
            <p>Leaſt hee might vvaxe inſolent, and proude againſt GOD, lyke Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer, when hee ietted it in his royall Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at Babell.</p>
            <p>Or like Alexander, Sonne to this King Phillippe, who after this, farre vnlyke his Father, being rapt away with the high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of honour, termed himſelfe a God. To verifie that, which hath beene long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
<pb facs="tcp:3643:102"/> fore-tolde by the propheticall King: <hi>Man being in honour, may be compared to the beasts that perriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conſideration of a mans ſelfe, it is the very eye of the ſoule, vvhereby ſhee looketh and pryeth into her vvhole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
            <p>It is the very doore of humility: and where it is ſoundly planted in any religious Chriſtian, it ſo beauti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This conſideration was in Dauid, when looking firſt vppon him-ſelfe: hee after looked vp to GOD, and exclaymed with a rauiſhing kinde of admiration. <hi>(O Lord) what is man, that thou ſhouldst be ſo mindfull of him: or what is this mortall generation, that thou ſhouldst ſo graciouſly viſite it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And agayne, in a greater meaſure of humility, in the two and twentieth Pſalm: hee calles hym-ſelfe a vvorme, and no man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue ſaide to corruption, thou art my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to rottennes, thou art my mother.</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:3643:103"/>
            <p>Moſes the ſeruant of God, and the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt man vppon the earth, thought there could be no greater argument of perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to draw the Iſraelites to the true ſeruice of God, than this we now ſpeake of, being taken from the perſon of man. <hi>I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen thee from among all Nations vnder heauen, to be a peculier people to my ſelfe: therefore thou ſhalt obſerue all my ordinances to doe them:</hi> And againe, in the 40. of Exodus, <hi>Thou art my first borne, &amp;c. Therefore I looke that thou obſerue my commaundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A certaine deuoute man was woont to thanke God for three things</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that God had made him a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature, not a beaſt.</p>
            <p>2. For making him a man, and not a woman.</p>
            <p>3. For making him a Chriſtian man.</p>
            <p>Where this or the like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration goeth before, there ſinne and ſathan following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, can no more preuaile againſt thee, than the Philiſtines could againſt Sampſon, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he brake the cords.</p>
            <p>I ſay, if wee doe but conſider, what wee are, how weake and corruptible we are, and what great thinges notwithſtanding God
<pb facs="tcp:3643:103"/> hath done for vs, in making vs of nothing, giuing vs the whole worlde to commaund, and the creatures in it; the ſunne to ſhine to vs, the fire to warme vs, the earth to beare vs, beaſtes, fowles, and fiſhes to feede vs. Theſe, and a thouſand times greater things than theſe, beeing duly conſidered, muſt needes produce in vs an effectuall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for performance of this righteouſnes we ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>God being ſo mindful of vs, ſhould force vs to bee mindfull of him, in the carefull practiſe of his commaundementes. And thus much for the firſt argument, drawne from the perſon of our ſelues.</p>
            <p>The ſecond argument is taken from the perſon of God: noted in the word <hi>ſhalt not.</hi>

            <q>Thou ſhalt not goe about with tales. &amp;c.</q>
            <p>The principall matter heere forbidden by expreſſe words in this commandement, is, the carrying of tales.</p>
            <p>There are many ſorts of paſſengers, that doe intercourſe betweene man &amp; man.</p>
            <p>Princes haue their Embaſſadours, that eyther doe denounce open warre and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, or elſe doe intreate for peace.</p>
            <p>Noble men haue their attedants and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,

            <p>Miniſters, are Gods meſſengers, to preach good tydings, the glad tydinges of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: thereby to reconcile ſinners vnto God, through the word of reconciliation.</p>
            <p>Merchants haue theyr Factours on thys ſide and beyond the Seas, which tranſport newes and other matter concerning theyr traffique. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>No poſt, no paſſenger, no trauailer, nor no Embaſſadour in the world, euer carried

            <p>Princes Embaſſadours are neceſſarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and without ſuch exerciſing theyr places and offices in all dutifull dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence &amp; fidelity, the ſtate of kingdoms can not be maintained.

            <p>Where the Bee drawes forth honny, theſe like Spyders ſuck out poyſon, and with the ſame as by a generall contagion, do ſeeke to infect the whole world.</p>

            <p>He in Saint Peters Epiſtle is called a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer, and ſo are they.</p>
            <p>Note well Saint Peter his deſcription of
<pb facs="tcp:3643:107"/> ſathan, and ſee if they be not ſathans.</p>
            <p>Saint Peter ſaith, <hi>he goeth about:</hi> As the Keeper rayles in his Deere, ſo the deuill makes his raile about vs, to the end we may not eſcape him. And euen ſo do Tale-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers goe about, as Saint Paul hath teſtifyed of them, beeing buſie-bodies, they learn to goe about from houſe to houſe, yea, they are not onely idle, but alſo pratlers, &amp; ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things that are not comly. 1. Tim. 5. 13.</p>
            <p>The ſecond property of ſathan is to roare in his walke: <hi>hee goeth about like a roaring Lyon,</hi> and ſo dooth the Tale-teller roare as he walkes like a Lion: but indeed the moſt part of them are Lyoneſſes. They ſpare no words that may furniſh the matter, before they will goe away vnheard, they wil make a double and treble repetion of that they ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, S. Peter ſaith the deuill ſeekes as he goeth, &amp; ſo doe they: they are as glad of a tale by the end, as a fryer of a pudding.</p>
            <p>At laſt comes in, to deuoure: <hi>ſeeking who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may deuoure:</hi> &amp; there he ends: ſhewing that to deuoure is his purpoſe, and ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure is their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The deuill hath a deepe ſwallowe, and
<pb facs="tcp:3643:107"/> therefore he is called <hi>Diabolos, quaſi duo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ls:</hi> he makes but two morſels of a man: &amp; in that reſpect hee may well be called a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer. No leſſe deuourer is the tale-gueſt. For Salomon, the only experimented man of the world, he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered of al things, conſidered this alſo among reſt.</p>
            <p>There is a generation (ſaith hee) of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Prou, 30. 14</note> whoſe teeth are as ſwordes, and theyr chawes as kniues, to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth, and the poore fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among men.</p>
            <p>Other men carry their ſwordes by theyr ſides, but theſe carry them in their mouthes, becauſe they may draw them forth at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Theſe people are worſe then Crowes: for they feede but vpon dead carkaſſes but theſe carriers of tales feede vpon them that are aliue. Like thoſe Anth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To cut vp the Anatomy, &amp; to embowel it throughly for a cleerer viewe: to what ſhall I liken this generation? They are like a moath: as a moath eates a hole in cloath, ſo theſe eate holes in euery mans coate.</p>

            <p>Theſe wicked Iſmaelites, who oppoſe themſelues againſt all the worlde, are by ſo much the more odious, for that theyr chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering tongues offending all mens eares with a more then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>VVhen there ſhall be no men vpon the

            <p>Hell, and the Tale-bearer are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: <note place="margin">Like the Horſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is no way to bee rid of a ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but eyther by cutting out his tongue: that though he can deuiſe and heare, yet he cannot vtter what hee hath heard or deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Or elſe, by ſhutting him out of all companie, that he might neyther heare nor ſee.</p>
            <p>For as it was permitted to Abraham to ſee the ſmoake of Sodom, but Lot might not be pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As the charitable peace-makers labour to breed peace, and good wil among men: ſo theſe make-bates ſtraine their endeuours to ſette men together by the eares.</p>
            <p>They are alwaies ſowing the ſeed of deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betwixt one &amp; another, as the enuious
<pb facs="tcp:3643:109"/> man ſowed ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>res in the husbandmans field while he ſlept.</p>
            <p>When men are ſleeping, then bee theſe waking, and walking about like Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowes, being aſhamed the day ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouer them, becauſe theyr deedes are euill.</p>
            <p>Theſe meſſengers of ſathan, as they ſhew themſelues vigilant and diligent, ſo are they pollitick withall, and full of craft, like theyr crafts-maiſter the deuill.</p>
            <p>For when they deliuer any matter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy and manifeſt vntruth, they indent &amp; couenaunt with the partie to whom they diſcouer it, that hee ſhall not bewray them, or make them the Authors of the report. And all to blinde the truth, and to ſtop all the meanes whereby it may be found out.</p>
            <p>If men woulde be aduiſed to take heede howe they entertaine ſuch idle circumceli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or if they did but publiſh their names to the world, much contention and hatred would be ſlopped.</p>
            <p>The Tale-hearer is as much in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned as the Tale-bearer. For many are light of hearing, and are apt to receiue with open eares what-ſoeuer is told them by whiſperers, and flatterers, and
<pb facs="tcp:3643:109"/> the like. As the Athenians gaue themſelues to heare newes, ſo doe theſe to heare tales.</p>
            <p>Micah was not halfe ſo willing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a Leuit, as a number be nowe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine tale-gueſts.</p>
            <p>Others be ſo light of credit, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they heare told, that they beleeue, and do ſo beleeue the firſt tale, that they wil not beleeue the ſecond: and theſe are <hi>homines altera tantum parte auriti.</hi> And they deſerue to haue but one eare, that will not heare with both.</p>
            <p>A third ſort there is which is worſt of all, ſome are ſo wayward and ſo froward, that they wil neuer or very hardly be reconciled after they haue beene once prepoſſeſt with ſiniſter reports.</p>
            <p>And this varietie of ill-affected humors in men, ſpring all from the Tale-bearer, or from the back-byter, who cannot in anie wiſe brooke that peace ſhould reſt among men.</p>
            <p>When the Lord had determined Achabs fall, a ſpirit came foorth and ſtoode before the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>I will goe foorth and bee a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Tale-teller, he alſo ſtands vp like
<pb facs="tcp:3643:110"/> a ſpeedie meſſenger, &amp; he like a lying ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, poſſeſſeth both the mouthes and harts of all men, to make them fall.</p>
            <p>If God ſhould make vs ſee our countrey diſpeopled, our Citties ranſacked, and our houſes ſpoyled, as GOD graunt our eyes may neuer ſee ſuch ruines, wee might ſay, The enemy hath been here. So when wee ſee our peace become confuſion, our vnitie turned to enuy, our good lyking turned to froward grudging: When friends become foes, and neighbours aduerſaries one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, vvee may well ſay, The Tale-bearer, or the ſlaunderer, or the back-byter hath beene heere.</p>
            <p>Thus are weeds ſprung vp where grapes ſhould haue beene planted.</p>
            <p>But why goe I about to waſh a Negro: vvho vvill ſtill be blacke, though hee were waſht vvith all the ſope of the goſpel.</p>

               <hi>And when he ſaw it pleaſed the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bloody perſecuting Tirant, did vex the Church of God by killing Iames with the ſword, &amp; by impriſoning Peter, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſpatch him in like manner, hauing no cauſe at all.</p>
            <p>Sometimes men perſecute of malice, as Caine did Abel: ſometimes of enuie, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau did Iacob: ſometimes through Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and for religion, as Nabucadnezer did the three chyldren: ſomtimes of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as Iudas did his maiſter: ſometimes of ignorance, as the Iewes in putting Chriſt to death: <hi>Father forgiue them, they know not what they doe.</hi>

            <p>Thus did Herod, and the ſame doe the wicked Tyrants continually, buy the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour &amp; good lyking of their ſubiects, with the blood of Gods ſeruaunts.</p>

            <p>Saul, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perſecuted Dauid, had ſome pretence, for he feared his kingdome.</p>
            <p>The Philippians in like maner had ſome pretence, when they beate Paul and Sylas with rods, and after caſt them into priſon. <hi>They trouble our Citty</hi> (quoth they) <hi>&amp; preach ordinances that are not lawfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Demetrius had ſomewhat to colour the ſedition and tumult raiſd in their Citty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Paul: he feared his craft would little auaile him, if Paules doctrine had taken place, for beeing a ſiluer Smith, hee made ſhrines for Diana.</p>
            <p>The king of Babilon had ſome pretence, when he put the three children into the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie furnace: he feared that the Gods who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he worſhipped ſhould be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>The Princes of Zedechiah had ſome pretence, when they put Ieremie into the dungeon: <hi>He weakened,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the hands of the men of warre,</hi> in prophecying, that their Citty ſhould bee giuen ouer, into the hands of the King of Babell.</p>
            <p>Theſe pretences how colourable ſo euer, could not excuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their actions; they were but baſe <hi>ſubterfuges,</hi> no better then coates of nettes, or like Fig-leaues, to couer
<pb facs="tcp:3643:114"/> the nakednes of their cauſe, of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and leſſe ſubſtance. Yet they carried ſome ſhew of reaſon, and with men made of the ſame griſt, might ſeeme to bee of force in defence of that they did.</p>
            <p>But this reaſon of Herod, for impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Peter, is too too vaine, and ridiculous, onely he did it, becauſe hee ſawe it pleaſed the people.</p>
            <p>The like we reade of Peſtus, in the Acts, willing to doe the Iewes a pleaſure, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

            <p>And ſo Pilat, for feare of the Iewes, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered Chriſt to be crucified.</p>
            <p>It skilleth much how the people are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: if the multitude be religious, &amp; doe loue the word tyrants ſhall not dare to rage ſo much; their tyrannous purpoſes howe wicked ſo euer ſhal not break out no more then the practiſes of the Scribes &amp; Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies could preuaile againſt Iohn, to put him openly to death, becauſe of the multitude; for all the people counted Iohn as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.

            <p>A King hath a name of ſoueraignty, hee is called, <hi>Rex a Regendo,</hi> he muſt gouerne, and not be gouerned.</p>

            <p>This Herod, could not abide that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od could Iohn Baptiſt. And finding the applauſe of the people to concurre with his practiſe, hee is the rather whetted on to doe wickedly.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the ſucceſſe and growth of religion depends ſo much vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples lyking or diſlyking: the Miniſter of the word ought eſpecially to labour in this, that the people bewel informed in the true way, &amp; be ſoundly taught to know God, if they ſhall ſhew themſelues zealous profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. Though a wicked tyrant did raigne
<pb facs="tcp:3643:115"/> ouer them, yet ſhould hee not preuaile to doe hurt to the children of God. </p>
            <q>It pleaſed the people.</q>
            <p>Heere is great ods, &amp; a manifeſt inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: one againſt many, and many againſt one. The whole people oppoſe themſelues againſt Peter, to deſtory him, like ſo many Philiſtims againſt Sampſon: but as Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon brake the cords, ſo Peter brake the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. or rather God for Peter opened the priſon, and ſo hee eſcaped, and ſo Herods expectation was fruſtied, the multitude of their purpoſe diſappoynted, &amp; the glory of God mightily magniſied: as ſhall appeare in the ſequell of the ſtory.</p>
            <p>You haue heard the reaſon why Herod tooke Peter: Heere it followes, how he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, where wee are firſt to note in a word, the degrees of Herods cruelty.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he tooke him, or caught him, which argues, that he lay in waite for him before: then he committed him to priſon, &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be kept with a ſtraite guard, no leſſe then foure quaternions of Souldiers. Laſtly, hee purpoſed after the feaſt, to put him to death: that was the mark he aymed at, and the drift of his endeuours. His ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb facs="tcp:3643:115"/> of him, his committing him to priſon, his diligence in cloſe and ſure kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him, all was to murther him at laſt.</p>
            <p>The deuils purpoſes, and tyrants practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are both one: hee is an aduerſary, hee goeth about, he ſeeketh, he roa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth: So doe tyrants, they neuer reſt going about, ſeeking, watching, threating, till at length they haue deuoured vs.</p>
            <p>Mark the care that Herod took to keepe Peter, that hee ſhould by no meanes ſtart from him: hee would neuer haue vſed the like carefulnes in any good matter. A qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternion contayned foure Souldiours, ſo the whole make ſixteene. There was a keeper before the dore of the priſon, and two with him, betwixt whom hee lay, and the reſt round about him, in their ſeuerall wards or ſtations: this was notable diligence, they meant to make ſure worke.</p>
            <p>This theyr ouer vvarie circumſpection, was no doubt a teſtimonie of a guilty and diſtruſtfull conſcience. In this tyrant ſo many circumſtances in this Scripture deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, concerning the apprehenſion of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may ſtand in ſteed of ſo many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes accuſing him within of wrongfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:116"/> Hee ſaw in him ſelfe that hee had no iuſt cauſe to doe it, and therefore he feared that this priſoner vvould by ſome meanes get from him, notwithſtanding this ſo ſure a watch.</p>
            <p>Such was Herods watchfulnes; and ſuch was <hi>Peters</hi> vveakeneſſe, that no reſiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Dalilah did thinke ſhe had made Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon faſt enough with ropes and cords; but through his ſtrength he brake them.</p>
            <p>Saul thought he had Dauid ſure enough when hee was in his bed; but hee eſcaped out of his hands, his vvife Micholl letting him downe at a window.</p>
            <p>Paule was by an earthquake deliuered out of pryſon: and at another time the Iewes tooke counſaile to kill him; they laid vvayte day and night at the gates to take him: but the other Apoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>les put him out at a wall and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t him downe in a basket, and ſo he eſcaped.</p>
            <p>And in this place, the Angell deliuereth
<pb facs="tcp:3643:116"/> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> in like ſort, from the hands of them who ſought to ſlay him.</p>
            <p>Rather then the enemie ſhall inſult ouer the children of God: hee will worke a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, the rather to procure their ſafety e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen beyond all expectation.</p>
            <p>As Elias was fed by a Rauen, at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſide: and Daniell refreſhed with the pottage that Abacuck brought vnto him, when he lay in the Lyons denne.</p>
            <p>And as Ehſha compaſſed his aduerſaries, while they compaſſed him.</p>
            <p>So in the midſt of all our afflictions, God will make a way for vs eſcape, if it bee good for vs, and ſtand with his will.</p>
            <p>As the hills ſtand about Ieruſalem, ſo the Lord cauſeth a whole Armie of Angels to ſtand about vs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> is all this while in priſon: &amp; what dooth he in the midſt of theſe ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities?</p>
            <p>Our text tells vs what he did. </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Hee ſlept.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>VVhat meanes <hi>Peter</hi> to ſleepe in ſo great a daunger: as if hee vvere altogether
<pb facs="tcp:3643:117"/> careleſſe, as if hee had beene poſſeſt with a ſtoycall ſtupidity, without all ſence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and this ſecurity or careleſnes to reſt vpon him then, when hee was ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne vp his life; euen the very night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould be brought forth to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>Indeede, by reaſon of long watching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all the former time of his indurance, nature might haue forced him to ſlumber a little: but the words are <hi>(he ſlept)</hi> it was a ſound ſleepe that he ſlept.</p>
            <p>His danger ſo imminent, &amp; his ſorrowes full of terrour and fearefulnes, beeing the poſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maiſters of death, ſhould haue beene able to keepe him waking, and not to ſuffer the temples of his head to reſt.</p>
            <p>Some there are that expound this ſleepe of Peter, to ſignifie not a diſſolute careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but a godly ſecurity, &amp; confident truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in him.</p>
            <p>God commaunds vs to caſt our care vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, for he careth for vs: and ſo Peter knowing that God did care for him, did caſt his care vpon the Lord. And therfore he miſtruſting no euill, ſuffered his body to take his repoſe: hee knewe that God, the
<pb facs="tcp:3643:117"/> watchman of Iſraell, was alſo his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and ſo the rather might he ſleepe in ſafety.</p>
            <p>Peter had commended him ſelfe to his prouidence and protection: hee knew his quarrell to be good, if he were to die, it was in the Lords cauſe; and theſe reaſons made him ſleepe ſo ſoundly.</p>
            <p>Others interprete this place otherwiſe; they hold this ſleeping in Peter to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of nature, and a great weakenes in him: for which, he was worthy reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; then to be ſleeping when hee ſhould haue been moſt watchfull, in attending the Lords leaſure, and in laying hold vpon the Lords mercies, in working his deliuerance. God would haue him to be a ſpectacle of infirmity, to the end wee looking into our ſelues, ſhould acknowledge our owne frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>Say, hee had caſt all his care vppon the Lord, and was aſſured that nothing ſhould befall him contrary to Gods appointment, yet ſhould he haue beene watchfull, as the Angel was watchfull ouer him.</p>
            <p>The Lord indeede hath promiſed neuer to faile vs, nor forſake vs in our troubles:
<pb facs="tcp:3643:118"/> yet he will not haue vs to doe nothing our ſelues: but as God worketh, ſo muſt wee work with him, &amp; call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our endeuours to further that which God will haue effected.</p>
            <p>Who ſo falleth into a ditch, &amp; prayeth to the Lord to be deliuered thence, &amp; yet will not ſeeke to raiſe himſelfe with one of his fingers, ſhall be ſure neuer to get forth.</p>
            <p>God helpeth by meanes, &amp; he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth thoſe meanes, muſt not looke for helpe. Let vs put to our endeuors, &amp; if they come ſhort, Gods helping hand wil be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to yeeld a preſent ſupply.</p>
            <p>Though hee had ſlept all the time of his impriſonment, yet now being the laſt night before his determined execution, he ſhould haue beene watchfull: he ſhould haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlowed this time in prayer &amp; meditation.</p>
            <p>Chriſt rebuked the Diſciples, for that they ſlept the very night before he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. <hi>Peter, ſleepest thou, couldest thou not watch one houre: Watch, and pray, least ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into temptation.</hi> Hee came againe the 2. and third time, and found them ſleeping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> was careleſſe then for his Maiſter: and in this place, he is as careleſſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; lyke Ionas, ſleeping vnder the Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:118"/> when hee was in ieopardie of drovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Hee was ſo heauy, and in ſuch a dead ſleepe, as we ſay, that the Angell was faine to ſtrike him on the ſide, before hee would awake.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Peter</hi> ſlept, the reſt of Gods Church ſlept not: The other Apoſtles greeuing at his troubles, and vexed in ſpirit at Herods cruelty, and his impriſonment, made earneſt prayer vnto God for him.</p>
            <p>Where we are to note the ſimpathy and mutual feeling that one me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber hath with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Peters paſſions wrought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion in the brethren, and therfore they both ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for him, &amp; prayed for him. It gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to ſee ſo notable an inſtrument of Gods glory lie in bonds.</p>
            <p>To teach vs to haue a feeling each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers calamity, to bee touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, in beholding our brethrens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes and miſeries.</p>
            <p>They could not helpe him out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor ſet him free: they ſawe that there was no way poſſible for him to eſcape in the iudgment of man: therfore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him vnto God, praying him not to
<pb facs="tcp:3643:119"/> leaue him comfortleſſe: nor to ſuffer him to be ſwallowed vp by the malicious cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>They were perſwaded that theſe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Peter were inflicted vpon him, by the ſpeciall appoyntment of God, for the tryall of his faith and patience: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted him vnto God in their prayers, as vnto a faithfull Creator. </p>
            <q>Prayer was made.</q>
            <p>God hath giuen vnto euery lyuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his weapon to defend himſelfe againſt the enemie.</p>
            <p>To the Lyon his taile, to the Elephant his noſe, to the Bee his ſting, to the Bore his tuske, to the Bull his hornes, to the Cocke his ſpurres, to the Eagle his talents, to the Hedgehogge his prickles, to the Horſe his heeles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Beare his pawes, to the fiſh his ſinnes: but to man, to vs that are his reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures, he hath giuen one weapon more forcible then all the weapons of war, that is to ſay, <hi>Prayer,</hi> iſſuing from faith out of a pure hart.</p>
            <p>This hath beene the courſe of the godly, in all ages, when the church of God, or any one member thereof hath been afflicted.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:119"/>
            <p>There was comfort in Peter, though he were eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in bonds: for it is ſaid, <hi>He ſlept that night, &amp;c.</hi> And there was alſo confidence in the congregation; for they prayed for Peter, hoping that GOD would deliuer him.</p>
            <p>We can looke for nothing ſo long as we remaine diſtruſtfull: for fayth alone muſt ſupport vs.</p>
            <p>In all troubles that ſhall aſſaile vs, fayth alone muſt be ſent forth to gaine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: and vntill wee be arined with this faith, we are not fit to march with Chriſt, as none might goe to battell with Gedeon, which were timorous and fearefull.</p>
            <p>Though wee ſeeme neuer ſo weake, and our aduerſaries neuer ſo ſtrong let them be mighty and tall, like the Enakyms. Yet if wee haue faith, and doe truſt in God, wee ſhall be ſtrong enough to ſaue our ſelues, and to foyle our foes like Gedeon, vvith his empty pitchers.</p>
            <p>Dauid hauing courage and confidence, when hee tooke with him but a ſling and ſtone, feared not to encounter with Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah of Gath: notwithſtanding, that he came againſt him with a ſhield of braſſe, and his

            <p>The Lord accepts not a colde prayer, a lip-prayer, from the teeth outward: ſuch praying, or ſuch babling rather is thus chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by our Sauiour. <hi>This people draweth nigh vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth</hi>

               <hi>Earnest Prayer was made by the Church.]</hi> Heere is diſcourſed not onely the manner of prayer, but the perſons alſo by whom it was offered: it was a prayer made by the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The prayer of the iust preuaileth much, if</hi>

            <p>The wicked mans prayer is abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Cayn and Habell did both ſacrifice vnto the Lord: but Habels was onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>To wicked Sacrifices marke vvhat the Lorde ſpeaketh, in Eſa 1. <hi>What haue I to doe with the multitudes of your Sacrifices: I am full of the burnt efferings of Rammes, and of the fatte of ſed beasts.

            </p>
            <q>Prayer was made vnto God.</q>
            <p>This ſheweth to whom we are to pray, only to God. We may not with our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries the Papiſts runne to Saints, to ſeeke

            <p>The prayer thus offered of holy men, in a feeling zeale, and feruencie of ſpirit vnto God. is a ſanctified prayer, an acceptable prayer; a prayer that pearceth the cloudes, preſſeth vnto the preſence of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth not empty vnto them that poure it forth.</p>
            <p>Such was the prayer of meeke Moſes, for the Iſraehtes, againſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.</p>
            <p>Such was the prayer of Iehoſaphat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ammon and Moab, and preuailed.</p>
            <p>Such vvas the praver of the godlie for <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Acts, againſt his perſecutours, and preuailed.</p>
            <p>And ſuch was the prayer of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation heere for <hi>Peter,</hi> and it likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.</p>
            <p>Such a prayer doth the Lord looke for, for ſuch a prayer doth he call vpon Dauid, and vs, in Dauid in the 149. pſalm. <hi>Call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me in the day of tribulation: and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer

            </p>
            <p>It was not the ſling, but the prayer of Dauid, that cauſed the ſtone to ſincke into the fore-head of the vncircumciſed Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>an.</p>
            <q>And behold, the Angell of the Lord came. &amp;c.</q>
            <p>See heere the powerfull effect of prayer. As the Church ſent ſoorth theyr prayers, ſo here God ſends forth his Angell to execute that which they prayed for.</p>
            <p>Rather then the prayer of the iuſt ſhould faſt, God ceaſed not to worke <hi>Peters</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance by a miracle.</p>
            <p>The Angell ſmote <hi>Peter</hi> on the ſide, &amp; rayſed him vp, ſaying? Vp quickly, and the chaynes fell off from his hands.</p>
            <p>Theyr prayer found a ſpeedy ſucceſſe, in a moſt ſtrange and extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> beyond all expectation, is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a greater comfort to Gods church: and the greater terrour to the perſecuting Tyrant.</p>
            <p>So hath God his enemies in deriſion, &amp; laughes them to ſcorne in theyr owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatious.
<pb facs="tcp:3643:122"/> When they thought themſelues moſt ſure of <hi>Peter,</hi> euen then they finde them-ſelues moſt deceiued.</p>
            <p>Herod did purpoſe on the next morrow to put <hi>Peter</hi> to death, but hee failed of his purpoſe: as the Philiſtims failed of Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though he lay bound with great cords in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>So man doth purpoſe, but God doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe: man imagineth, but God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all to the beſt for them that loue him.</p>
            <p>Hence we are to learne, that what-ſoeuer troubles ſhall happen vnto vs, they bee knowne before hande, &amp; are eſpecially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vpon whom they ſhall fall: ſo that they cannot come ſooner or later vnto vs, nor can preuaile further againſt vs, then GOD ſhall permit: as God gaue Herod power to take <hi>Peter,</hi> but he had no power to kill him.</p>
            <p>The Lord cutteth ſhort the arme of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants at his pleaſure, hee can put a brydle in theyr mouthes, and an hooke in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, as he did Zenacharib, when he came vp againſt Ezechiah. </p>
            <q>The Angell ſet Peter at libertie.</q>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:122"/>
            <p>Many ſuch examples of the Lordes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence ouer his elect we find in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in the ſixt of the ſecond of Kinges, when the ſeruaunt of Eliſeus roſe vp earely in the morning to goe out, an hoſt of men ſent thether from the King of Aram com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Citty rounde about with horſes and charyots; and he cryed to his Maiſter, <hi>Alas we perriſh.</hi> But he aunſwered, <hi>Feare not, they that are with vs, are more then they that are with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Eliſha prayed that the Lord would open the eyes of his ſeruaunt, that he might ſee, and he looked, and beholde the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was full of horſes and chariots of fire round about Eliſha. There we find Gods gracious prouidence garding the prophet: and heere we find another preſident of the like prouidence of God in reſcuing <hi>Peter</hi> by the miniſtery of an Angell, from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent rage of Herod.</p>
            <p>An Angell appeared to Paule in that <note place="margin">Acts, 27.</note> dangerous viage, and told him that none in the ſhyp ſhould perriſh.</p>
            <p>And here an Angell tells <hi>Peter</hi> that hee ſhall not miſcarry nor perriſh, though hee were euen nowe ſhutte vp in the loweſt
<pb facs="tcp:3643:123"/> dungeon, and kept with foure quaternions of ſouldiours.</p>
            <p>Lot by Angels was deliuered from the flames of Sodome.</p>
            <p>Rather then the three children ſhould be conſumed in the ſiery Ouen, God ſent his Angell to protect them, cauſing the fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature to loſe his heate, &amp; as it were to quench it ſelfe in his owne flame.</p>
            <p>The fire loſt his heat, as the yron chaines loſt theyr ſtrength when they fell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hands.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſtand vppon particulars, when as the prophet Dauid ſaith; <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Lord pitch theyr camps round about them that feare him, and deliuereth them.</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>So Peter came and followed him, and knew not that it was true.</q>
            <p>This deliueraunce came to <hi>Peter</hi> vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, as appeareth by theſe words. Had he knowne of thys happy newes, he would ſurely haue watched for the Angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: and not haue ſuffered his eyes to ſleep, being a time ſo full of peril, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death was preſented before him. And vpon the next morrow, he was to bee
<pb facs="tcp:3643:123"/> ledde to the place of execution.</p>
            <p>Well, comming vnlooked for, it was by ſo much the better welcome: and it was a motiue of forcible efficacie, to cauſe Peter enter into a deeper conſideration of Gods goodnes, in ſo ſtrange a ſort working his deliueraunce.</p>
            <p>This circumſtance in Peters deliuerance is woorth the nothing, viz. The time of the Angels comming, when now there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no hope of any euaſion or eſcape out of their hands: for vpon the day following Herod thought to diſpatch him. Euen then in the moment as it were of his greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, comes the Angell &amp; openeth the priſon doores, and cauſeth the chaynes to fall from his handes: and ſo <hi>Peter</hi> eſcapeth almoſt before he awaketh, or before he can haue any leyſure to conſider of his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>The hiſtorie ſpeaketh, that hee thought he had ſeene a viſion.</p>
            <p>So was Dauid deliuered from the handes of Saul, and Ieruſalem from the tyranny of the King of Aſhur, and Samaria from the Aramites; and this hapned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon a ſudden, when no help was expected.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:124"/>
            <p>In that it pleaſed God not to deliuer him ſooner, it proueth that the Lorde will haue the meaſure of affliction left to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>He will ſift vs to the vttermoſt to try our patience.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour had told <hi>Peter</hi> before, that ſathan ſhould winow both him and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, as one winoweth VVheate. And here hee findes it true, that ſathan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had winowed him by his inſtruments of crueltie, Herod and the reſt, &amp; hee was euen nowe at the next doore to death. But the prouidence of God became vnto him a preſent helpe in time of trouble: he reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from the violence of his mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, and ſtayed theyr furie in the very inſtant. As the Angell ſtayde Abrahams hande, vvhen the fatall blowe vvas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>The very night before Herod purpoſed to bring him out to the people, came thys vnexpected deliuerance.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſuffered the ſhyppe to be almoſt vnder the waues before hee woulde awake. God went farre with Heliah, when he was forced to flie from Ieſabell: and to cry out,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:124"/> They haue killed the prophets: &amp; I alone <note place="margin">1, Reg, 19.</note> am left, and they ſeeke my ſoule.</p>
            <p>And Dauid the freend of God, was put to his ſhy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts, when he cryed out in greefe &amp; anguiſh of his ſoule, Why dooſt thou turne away thy face, and why forgetteſt thou my <note place="margin">Pſalm, 30.</note> tribulation.</p>
            <p>And in another place, Chriſt ſuffered Peter to ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k, &amp; to be in danger of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before he would ſtretch out his hand to ſupport him.</p>
            <p>As heere, hee ſent not his Angell to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him forth of priſon, till the verie night before his execution.</p>
            <q>And when they were past the first and ſecond watch: they came to the yron gate, which opened vnto them of it owne accord.</q>
            <p>This is a further circumſtance of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous deliuerance. They paſſed throgh all the watches, and the watch-men neuer perceiued it. They came to the yron gate, and it opened voluntarily.</p>
            <p>Senceleſſe thinges made ſhewe of pittie, when neither King nor people could yeeld compaſſion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:125"/>
            <p>The chaynes &amp; linkes fell from him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and heere the yron gate giues way to <hi>Peter,</hi> both working out together his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueraunce.</p>
            <p>Theſe things muſt admoniſh vs of the forcible effect of prayer. </p>

            <p>Prayer it is that breaketh the ſtrongeſt pryſons, looſeth the yron bands, openeth the well-barred gates, &amp; draweth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels out of heauen to come to the earth to worke our deliuerance. </p>
            <q>Nowe I knowe of a truth that the Lorde hath ſent his Angell, and deliuered mee out of the hand of Herod, and from all the wayting for of the people of the Iewes.</q>
            <p>Heere is layd downe <hi>Peters</hi> thankfulnes after his deliuerance. Hee acknowledgeth the louing kindnes of the Lorde, who had ſo graciouſly ſet him free from the tyrannie of his enemies, that thirſted after his blood.</p>
            <p>We muſt learne by this example to giue thanks for what-ſoeuer benefits God ſhall powre vpon vs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:125"/>
            <p>For to receiue Gods benefits, and not to be thankfull for them, is to contemne God in them.</p>
            <p>The Lorde expecteth no retribution at our handes, <hi>Quis enim dedit ei,</hi> Who hath giuen vnto him, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. Yet hee will haue vs to he thankfull, that is the ſpeciall dutie that he requireth of vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who ſo offereth me thankes, hee honoureth me: and to him that ordereth his conuerſation aright, will I ſhew the ſaluation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If one man doe pleaſure or gratifie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there will be an expectancy of thanks at leaſt: and ſhall not the Lorde much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther require the ſame of vs, from whom we receaue our ſelues, our liues, and all that we are worth: the bread we feede vppon, the ground we tread vpon, the light wee looke vpon, all comes from God, and what-ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is within vs, or without vs, all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall graces, whereof each one is more worth then a thouſand worlds.</p>

            <p>You haue ſeene on the one ſide the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſolliciting, &amp; Herod conſenting to the death of Peter.</p>
            <p>They in theyr wicked purpoſes, and the King in his cruell practiſes, conſpired his ouerthrow.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, the congregation of the faithfull powred forth their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant peticions for Peter: and theſe more ſtrong then the yron bands, preuailed for his deliuerance.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:126"/>
            <p>Prayer went vp from them, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell came downe to him: and ſo was <hi>Peter</hi> deliuered, Herode of his purpoſe diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the Church comforted, &amp; Gods Name highly magnified.</p>

               <q>Syrs, what must I doe to be ſaued? And they ſaid, Beleeue in the Lorde Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaued, and thine houſhold.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THeſe words conſiſt of queſtion &amp; an aunſwere. The occaſion of the queſtion grewe thus, noted in the precedent verſes: When Paule and Sylas had beene impriſoned in the Citty of <hi>Philippi</hi> for the teſtimonie of Gods truth, and beeing now in the loweſt dungeon, it pleaſed the Lorde to worke theyr deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in a miraculous manner, as appeareth in the 26. verſe. For ſuddainly there came an Earth-quake, ſo that the foundation of the pryſon was ſhaken, and anone all the doores opened, &amp; euery mans bands were looſed: and the Iayler beeing ſtriken with a great terror, would ſtraight-wayes haue ſlaine himſelfe, had not Paule ſtaid his fury.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:127"/>
            <p>Where-vppon, after a more ſober conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, finding all the priſoners to bee there, euery man ſure and forth-comming, and withall, acknowledging the mightie power of God, he comes in great humility before Paule and Silas, &amp; he brought them forth and ſayd; <hi>Syrs, what must I doe to bee ſaued?</hi> Where we are to note the ſuddaine and ſtrange, &amp; yet not ſo ſtrange as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mighty operation of Gods Spirit in this Iaylor.</p>
            <p>He who euen nowe would haue ſpoyled himſelfe, ſeekes to ſaue himſelfe &amp; hee that but now was moſt deſperate, is becom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute, and moſt deſirous to be informed in the way of his ſaluation.</p>
            <p>So in a moment, hee becomes of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man a Chriſtian man, as if hee had beene made anewe, his affections cleane changed, his wicked reſolution altered, his crueltie turned to Chriſtianitie. All thys came vpon him in a moment, as vviſedom came vpon Saul, when a kingly ſpirit vvas giuen him. </p>
            <q>Sirs, what must I do to be ſaued?</q>
            <p>Heere it is verified, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3643:128"/> And again, <hi>I am not ſent but to the lost ſheep of the houſe of Iſraell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the power of God in his effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling of ſinners: Saul in his greateſt rage, when hee tyrannized moſt againſt Gods Saints, was vpon a ſuddaine made of Saul a perſecuter, Paule a profeſſour. The ſame powerfull Spirit wrought in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of Zacheus, making him of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican a zealous Chriſtian. So of ſtones, God can and ſtill dooth raiſe vp chyldren to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, as in this place he wrought in thys wicked and cruell ſaylor nowe to ſeeke the meanes of his ſaluation.</p>
            <p>He who ere-whiles had chained others, is nowe chayned vp himſelfe, and by the mighty power of God driuen to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe at his handes whom before hee deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſhut vp in the baſeſt place of his houſe.</p>
            <p>Feare made him runne to the Apoſtles: as ſhame draue Adam to the fig-trees. And he who before was lofty and proud, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull, nowe ſtoopes downe and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelfe, and diſcouers his ignorance, as Adam did his nakednes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs, what must I doe to be ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:128"/>
            <p>It is a voyce of paſſionate fearefulneſſe, ſuch as is wont to proceed from them that are diſtracted, and as it were at theyr wits end. What ſhall I doe.</p>
            <p>This Iaylour was not carefull howe to aunſwere the Rulers, that had committed them: nor doth he deuiſe what excuſe hee might make to the officers &amp; Magiſtrates, who in all likelihood would exact them at his handes, who had the cuſtodie of them. But all theſe matters layd apart, hee is nowe poſſeſſed with a deeper meditation, which is, how he may be ſaued.</p>
            <p>

            <p>And know you, that heare the Preacher for faſhion ſake, that goe home and ieſt at him your bellies full: that cenſure him at your pleaſures, that eate him at your feaſts, that buy and ſell him at your ſhoppes, that recreate your ſelues with his faults.</p>
            <p>The day will come when ye ſhall know, and be driuen to confeſſe, that Prophets haue beene among you: and then you will wiſh you had learned that which the Iaylor nowe teacheth you: which is, to humble your ſelues in all reuerence, euen at the feet of Gods meſſengers, and ſo to ſeeke the meanes of your ſaluation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then the firſt doore that openeth to Gods graces and treaſures, is humility.</p>
            <p>Many a faire and large houſe hath but a narrow entry, and a low doore.</p>
            <p>And ſo the lowe gate of humility is the doore of Gods houſe, narrow without, but within are many Manſions. And we muſt firſt paſſe by the narrow, before we come to the broad.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:130"/>
            <p>Hauing made this reuerent preparatiue, he comes to the matter. <hi>What must I doe to be ſaued?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This one queſtion is woorth all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may bee made: for in other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes whatſoeuer, a per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But this demaund, this one queſtion but once made, cuts off all others; and beeing but once aunſwered, wee reſt ſatisfied like this laylour, for it miniſtreth a full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our deſires.</p>
            <p>O that all men were like this Iaylour, to make like queſtions.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be our firſt demaund, but wee make it our laſt: after all the leſſons that wee haue learned, yet wee haue beene ſchooled in this: we haue not learned how to be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Wee haue no leaſure to thinke on this, for our other buſineſſes of the world call vs from it.</p>
            <p>Like thoſe lingerers in the Goſpell. Hee that ſhould haue followed Chriſt, ſayde,

            </p>
            <p>Still there will be one let or other to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs from ſaluation, like the fowles that cumbered Abraham in his ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Eyther we haue bought a yoake of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and muſt of neceſſity goe proue them: or we haue taken a Farme, &amp; we muſt goe ſee it: or we haue married a wife, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come.</p>
            <p>So we haue no time yet, and leſſe leaſure to learne how to be ſaued.</p>
            <p>We will learne this leſſon laſt of all, and after all, when we are moſt vnſit to learne, and haue almoſt quite loſt our wits &amp; our ſences then we will goe to ſchoole.</p>
            <p>This Iaylour did not ſo: ſo ſoone as hee felt the motion of Gods ſpirit within him, calling him to the knowledge of this holy leſſon, he lingers not, nor deferres the time; but hee ſuffers the ſpirit of God to worke him and to frame him now he is pliable, as the Smith doth his i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All generally ſettle their mindes vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, meerely contrary to this.</p>
            <p>The moſt part ſtudy howe they may be rich? how they may be honourable? how they may aduance themſelues, and ſo be magnified in this world.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:3643:134"/> that endeuoureth not to day, will be leſſe apt for any good to morrow.</p>
            <p>All men would gladly goe to heauen, but they cannot reſolue to goe yet: they would a while liue vpon the earth; they are not of this laylours mind, nor of Paules minde. <hi>I deſire,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be diſſolued:</hi> And <hi>what must I doe?</hi> He doth not ſo much as giue the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles leaue and reſpite to refreſh and feed themſelues he was ſo earneſt.</p>
            <p>As Abrahams ſeruant did not eate meate till hee had firſt tolde his meſſage: ſo the laylour would not ſuffer the Apoſtles nor himſelfe to eate meate, till he had told them his meſſage.</p>
            <p>Hee cared like Mary, rather to feede the ſoule then the body; not reſpecting the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing food, but rather that which ſhould feed him vp to eternall life.</p>
            <p>This ſheweth a carefull deſire in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: but we muſt proceede further than to a naked deſire. He that onely deſireth to doe well, and eyther goes no further, or retires backe againe where hee beganne: is like to the ſmoake which goeth vp towards heauen, but neuer comes there. Or like a cloude that mountes aloft, as long as the
<pb facs="tcp:3643:134"/> ſunnes heat laſteth; but the ſunne once ſet, it falleth downe to the earth faſter then it mounted vp.</p>
            <p>This laylour went further then ſo, for as we find him in this place deſiring to know the meanes of his ſaluation: ſo in the next verſe to my Text, wee finde him vſing the meanes of his ſaluation.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles were diligent to preach vnto him, &amp; he as diligent to heare them.</p>
            <p>As our bodies grow, ſo muſt our ſoules: firſt we creepe, and then we grow, and then we runne: ſo we muſt grow in the ſpirit, &amp; encreaſe in knowledge, and profit in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, till the man of God be perfect.</p>
            <p>As this laylour ſayde, <hi>What ſhall I doe to be ſaued:</hi> ſo let euery man ſay, What ſhall I doe to haue knowledge? vvhat ſhall I doe to haue fayth? vvhat ſhall I doe to haue charitie? vvhat ſhall I doe to haue zeale?</p>
            <p>All theſe are ſo many meanes of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and ſhall carry thee to heauen, faſter then the fierie chariot caried Elias thither, when he was tranſlated.</p>
            <p>And thus much is ſpoken briefely for the queſtion of the laylour.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3643:135"/>
            <p>Now let vs conſider of the Apoſtles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. <hi>Beleeue in the Lord Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaued and thy houſhold.</hi>

            <p>This is their aunſwere: hee was not ſo ready to aske, but they are as ready to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his demaund.</p>
            <p>Chriſtes Diſciples are like Chriſt; he in the 10. of Mark, anſwered thus to him that demaunded what he might doe to inherite eternall life: <hi>Hoc fac et viues: This doe and thou ſhalt liue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And heere the Apoſtles gaue like aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Iaylour: <hi>Doe this and thou ſhalt be ſaued.</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>Beleeue in the Lord Ieſus.</q>
            <p>Heere wee are to learne by this example of the Apoſtles, to be helpful to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or whom ſo euer we find fit for the Kingdome of God: wee ought to furniſh them with all ſpirituall knowledge: wee muſt like Peter, ſtrengthen them that are weake, when we our ſelues are ſtrong.</p>
            <p>But we ſee the contrary practiſed; for the greateſt part are apt to draw men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and from his truth; as the Athieſts &amp; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts of theſe times who ſtraine their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to make others like themſelues.</p>

            <p>They vvould perſwade men that they are too good, when they are ſtark naught.</p>
            <p>They will be ſtraight-wayes in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, before they haue attained the medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity: Like the lazie trauailer, that ſittes downe in the midſt of his iourney: or like him, that running in a race, giues ouer in the midſt of his courſe, and ſuffers others to get the goale before him.</p>
            <p>This is the reluctation betweene the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnholy, the children of light, and the children of the darknes.</p>
            <p>Good men ſtriue to be holy themſelues, and to beget holines in others: but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſtriue to be naught, and to make others worſe than themſelues.</p>
            <p>And the deuill comes in to act vp the tragedy, and ſo he rageth, and ſo ſinne ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth,
<pb facs="tcp:3643:136"/> &amp; ſo the weaknes of man yeeldeth, becauſe he hath not faith, in which only we can ouerthrow the world.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles ſinding this Iaylour in the way of his ſaluation, do help him forwards, and doe ſupport his weaknes: as Chriſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the loſt ſheepe vpon his ſhoulders, &amp; as the mercifull Samaritane did lay the man that lay by the way ſide robd &amp; wounded, vpon his owne beaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beleeue ſay they in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may ſeeme to be a leſſon ſoone lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the gayning of heauen a matter of ſhort and eaſie ſurprize, if it may be obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only by beleeuing in the Lord Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Indeed the anſwer is ſhort, but the matter of ſubſtance included therein is great: for as one tree hath many braunches, and one branch many bloſſoms: ſo this one anſwer hath many circumſtances. All which being duly conſidered, we ſhall be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it a matter of greateſt difficulty; and that we haue neede to call vpon Gods ſpirit, for his ſpecial furtherance in this great frame of our ſpirituall building.</p>
            <p>For it is not giuen to all, to beleeue in the Lord Ieſus, nay, it is giuen but to a fewe, to
<pb facs="tcp:3643:136"/> thoſe onely whom the Father hath ſealed for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Yea, euen the beſt of vs, to whom the Lorde hath giuen moſt talents of his rich graces, may ſay notwithſtanding, looking vpon our imperfections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord wee beleeue, helpe our unbeleefe, and the ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith in the ſtrongeſt, wil be found to be but a deficient faith, as Peters was, when he began to ſinke.</p>
            <p>God will haue it to be ſo, to the end we ſhould haue recourſe to the fulnes that is in Chriſt. That when we ſee our faith weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or wounded, wee ſhould doe, as they did, who were bitten by Scorpions: caſt vp our eyes to Chriſt, the brazen ſerpent, who will not ceaſe, ſince now he is lifred vp, to draw vs vp alſo vnto himſelfe. </p>
            <q>Beleeue in the Lord Ieſus.</q>
            <p>Asour Sauiour told Martha, one thing is neceſſary; ſo the Apoſtles tell this Iaylor, one thing is neceſſary to furniſh him for the Kingdome of heauen, <hi>euen faith: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To beleeue, is to giue conſent in thy hart
<pb facs="tcp:3643:137"/> to the worde of truth: to ſubſcribe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by an vnfained profeſſion, &amp; to yeeld all Chriſtian obedience aunſwerable to the meaſure of grace giuen vnto vs.</p>
            <p>This faith is begotten in vs, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate gift of God, and increaſed in vs by the word of God read and preached.</p>
            <p>God giues the word, and the word giues faith, and faith giues ſaluation.</p>
            <p>The Iewes reade the Scriptures, and they heard Chriſt preaching vnto them euery Sabaoth in their Sinagogues: yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not, becauſe the vaile was not taken from them: and they were ſtill in theyr ſinnes, to ſhew that faith is the ſpeciall gift of God, and all cannot receaue it, which makes ſo many to withſtand the truth in vngodlines.</p>
            <p>Where it is ſaid heere, <hi>Beleeue onely, and thou ſhalt be ſaued:</hi> Wee learne that faith is the onely principall inſtrument, whereby we apprehend Chriſt, and ſo conſequently our ſaluation.</p>

            <p>The other, a liuely, a iuſtifying fayth, which dooth not onely beleeue, but worke alſo in charity.</p>
            <p>And thus much may be ſpoken of fayth, which as Chriſoſtome ſaith, No man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, or vnderſtandeth a-right, but he that receaueth it: as no man knoweth the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of honey but he that hath ſeene it, and taſted it.</p>

            <p>In that he is called a Lord, wee muſt be directed onely by him: he muſt raigne in
<pb facs="tcp:3643:140"/> vs, and ouer vs.</p>
            <p>The homage wee muſt pay to this our Lord and King, is our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies. A liuing ſacrifice holy and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, which is our reaſonable ſeruice of God.</p>

            <p>God wil not be our Lord, vnleſſe we will become his ſeruaunts: but if wee ſerue the world, or our luſts, or our vanities, then we caſt his yoake from vs.</p>

            <p>There is no other name giuen vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whereby we muſt be ſaued, neither is ſaluation in any other.</p>
